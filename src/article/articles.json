However, downloads are continuing to grow, up 11% year-over-year in 2022 to reach 255 billion. Consumers are also spending more time in mobile apps than ever before. On Android devices alone, hours spent in 2022 grew 9%, reaching 4.1 trillion.\nThis Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and much more.\nDo you want This Week in Apps in your inbox every Saturday?

It was a big week for AI news as both Microsoft and Google took the stage at competing events to intro their AI developments to the public. Microsoft fared a little better with its news that OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT-like tech was coming to Bing, pushing its companion mobile app up into the App Store\u2019s top ranks. Meanwhile, Google flubbed a bit with its rival AI, Bard, which, in a published demonstration of the technology, shared an incorrect answer to a question about the James Webb Space Telescope (it was NOT the first to take a picture of an exoplanet, NASA says).\nWhile both AI models will frequently and confidently get things wrong at times, Google\u2019s failure to fact-check the answers it was showing off seemed to indicate the company was rushing out the tech in reaction to Microsoft\u2019s move into its territory\u2026which it was.\nGoogle should have been far ahead in this AI race, having invested in and developed AI technology for years with help from some of the top experts in the field. But it\u2019s been caught off guard \u2014 and not only by OpenAI.\nBefore this current AI race, Amazon\u2019s Alexa became the household name for AI-powered voice assistants. Google, on the other hand, got burned when it showed off some of its more impressive consumer applications of AI. It faced backlash over its consideration of AI ethics when it showed off Duplex\u2019s ability to call restaurants to book reservations while pretending to sound human. Google also often builds neat AI tools \u2014 like an AI that can generate music from text descriptions \u2014\u00a0but won\u2019t release them.\nThe company has seemed to be slow to move on AI \u2014 likely hesitant to upset its search and advertising cash cow that relies on ads sold atop a list of links. Microsoft doesn\u2019t care about that, though, noting that every 1% of search ad share gain it makes is a $2 billion revenue opp.\nThat\u2019s why what we\u2019ve gotten from Google around AI has been a sort of steady stream of smaller AI-powered feature drops over time, not some big and expensive overhaul of search that could have killed its margins.\nInstead, we get things like multisearch, which expands web search to include text and images combined. Google this week announced it was going global and the nearby option, multisearch near me, was also rolling out more broadly.\nGoogle\u2019s AI-powered \u2018multisearch,\u2019 which combines text and images in a single query, goes global\n\nThe company also rolled out other AI-powered improvements to things like translation and Google Maps. For example, Google at this week\u2019s event spoke about its new \u201cimmersive view\u201d maps offering more true-to-life scenes, which are created by leveraging an AI technique called neural radiance fields (NeRF). But these maps are only available in a handful of cities. And as cool as they are, they feel more like an iteration on Street View rather than a major AI leap.\nMeanwhile, Google used its event to show off a range of other features that weren\u2019t AI search demos or ChatGPT rivals. It introduced Maps\u2019 AR-powered Live View, which Google said is hitting a few more cities. (This requires users to hold up their phones and scan the area \u2014 not really a subtle gesture if you\u2019re trying to hide the fact that you\u2019re a tourist or even possibly lost!) And it talked about new EV Maps.\nMicrosoft, on the other hand, used its press event to fully focus on AI as the next evolution of search. It demoed its ChatGPT-like AI in Bing which is also integrated with its Edge web browser. And it talked in detail about the next-gen OpenAI large language model it\u2019s using, calling it \u201cmore powerful than ChatGPT,\u201d which certainly excited consumers.\nThe company also cleverly introduced a waitlist for the AI-powered Bing that required people to set Microsoft defaults on their PC and download the Bing app. As a result, the Bing app is now ranked in the top 10 on the U.S. App Store and is the No. 2 Productivity app behind Gmail. To put this in perspective, the Bing app ahead of the AI news had been ranked No. 160 on the U.S. App Store\u2019s Productivity apps chart \u2014 in other words, practically invisible.\nGoogle, meanwhile, lost $100 billion in market value as Alphabet\u2019s stock fell after the ad with the AI\u2019s mistake aired ahead of the company\u2019s event.\nWhile the big race in AI apps is still between Google and Microsoft (via OpenAI), AI will soon find its way into a number of mobile apps through integrations. Already, we\u2019ve seen the fake ChatGPT apps arrive and belatedly get the boot from the app stores. Today, a search for the term \u201cChatGPT\u201d still returns numerous apps that imply they\u2019re associated with OpenAI or simply presume users won\u2019t care, as long as they offer a ChatGPT-like experience. And we\u2019ve seen the AI image generators go viral.\u00a0Quora this week also introduced an AI playground called Poe, which features a handful of AI chatbots from OpenAI and Anthropic. (See \u201cDownloads\u201d section below.)\nConsumers are clearly hungry to see AI put to use in apps. The developments also enliven what\u2019s become a stale App Store over the years, as Apple blocked other new tech, like NFTs, blockchain transactions and Web3 technologies from being fully functional on its App Store, forcing startups to build their own.\nBing\u2019s app sees a 10x jump in downloads after Microsoft\u2019s AI news\n\nImage Credits: Jaap Arriens\/NurPhoto via Getty Images\nImage Credits: Jaap Arriens\/NurPhoto via Getty Images\nSome browser makers believe they\u2019ll be able to release their own, non-WebKit-powered browser apps in the future, thanks to expected regulations that would force Apple to open up its App Store to more competition.\nThis week, multiple stories emerged that top browser makers like Mozilla and Google have been working on the development of non-WebKit browser apps for iOS. Google Chromium developers, for instance, have begun building an iOS browser that uses Google\u2019s Blink engine \u2014 an app that today would not be allowed on the App Store, as Apple\u2019s guidelines specifically state that browser apps \u201cmust use the appropriate WebKit framework and WebKit Javascript.\u201d\nGoogle, however, downplayed the news, claiming it was only a prototype meant to help it learn about iOS performance.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson told us, \u201cThis is an experimental prototype that we are developing as part of an open-source project with the goal to understand certain aspects of performance on iOS. It will not be available to users and we\u2019ll continue to abide by Apple\u2019s policies.\u201d\nGoogle isn\u2019t the only one dabbling in this area. When reached for comment, Mozilla was far more transparent about its plans when it was spotted working on a Gecko-based version of Firefox for iOS, clearly indicating that its work is in anticipation of a more competitive landscape.\n\u201cWe abide by Apple\u2019s iOS app store policies, and are simply doing some exploratory work to understand the technical challenges for Gecko-based browsers on iOS if those policies were to change,\u201d a Mozilla spokesperson told us. \u201cWe hope the day will come when people can freely decide to use the browser of their choice, including the opportunity to select the engine that underpins it.\u201d\nOf course, even if Apple were to open up to non-WebKit browsers, it could theoretically impose other limits on competing apps to dictate how they\u2019re allowed to use system resources. That would be another reason for the companies to experiment now so they\u2019ll be ready to meet any such requirement if and when the App Store opens up.\nImage Credits: Jonathan Raa\/NurPhoto \/ Getty Images\nImage Credits: Jonathan Raa\/NurPhoto \/ Getty Images\nTikTok once again found itself as the social app kids and teens are spending the most time using throughout the day, even outpacing YouTube. According to an ongoing annual review of kids\u2019 and teens\u2019 app usage and behavior globally, the younger demographic \u2014 minors ranging in ages from 4 through 18 \u2014 began to watch more TikTok than YouTube on an average daily basis starting in June 2020, and TikTok\u2019s numbers have continued to grow ever since.\nIn June 2020, TikTok overtook YouTube for the first time, with kids watching an average of 82 minutes per day on TikTok versus an average of 75 minutes per day on YouTube, according to new data from parental control software maker Qustodio.\nThis past year, the gulf between the two widened, it said, as kids in 2022 saw their average daily use of TikTok climb to a whopping 107 minutes, or 60% longer than the time they spent watching video content on YouTube (67 minutes).\nImage Credits: Qustodio\nImage Credits: Qustodio\nTikTok was also used more, in terms of average daily minutes, than other social apps like Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter.\nThe study was published in advance of a TikTok-focused Congressional hearing. In March, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee about the app\u2019s data security, ties to China, privacy concerns and impacts on children.\nSocial media concerns also got a shoutout during President Biden\u2019s State of the Union address this week when he pressed Congress to pass legislation to protect consumers from Big Tech. \u201cWe must finally hold social media companies accountable\u2026It\u2019s time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of us.\u201d\nTikTok is crushing YouTube in annual study of kids\u2019 and teens\u2019 app usage\n\nImage Credits: Cyan Worlds\nImage Credits: Cyan Worlds\nImage Credits: Rogue Games\nImage Credits: Rogue Games\nImage Credits: Amo\nImage Credits: Amo\nImage Credits: Instagram\nImage Credits: Instagram\nImage Credits: WhatsApp\nImage Credits: WhatsApp\nImage Credits: OkCupid\nImage Credits: OkCupid\nImage Credits: Netflix\nImage Credits: Netflix\nNetflix starts cracking down on password sharing in four new markets, including Canada\n\nImage Credits: Spotify\nImage Credits: Spotify\nImage Credits: Quora\nImage Credits: Quora\nQ&A platform\u00a0Quora\u00a0opened up public access\u00a0to its new AI chatbot app,\u00a0Poe, which lets users ask questions and get answers from a range of AI chatbots, including those from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and other companies like Anthropic. Beyond allowing users to experiment with new AI technologies, Poe\u2019s content will ultimately help to evolve Quora itself. If and when Poe\u2019s content meets a high enough quality standard, it will be distributed on Quora\u2019s site itself, where it has the ability to reach Quora\u2019s 400 million monthly visitors, the company said.\nAt launch, there are three general knowledge chatbots: Sage, Claude and Dragonfly. Both Sage and Dragonfly are powered by OpenAI while Claude is powered by Anthropic technology. All have their own limitations at present. For instance, Sage and Claude don\u2019t have knowledge of events after 2021, and Dragonfly may refuse to answer some questions. All three have also been known to make incorrect statements \u2014 which is another reason why Quora itself isn\u2019t immediately integrating Poe into its service. Developers will also be able to add their own bots to Poe in the future.\nQuora opens its new AI chatbot app Poe to the general public\n\nImage Credits: Epic Games\nImage Credits: Epic Games\nFortnite maker Epic Games launched a new clip-sharing app called Postparty on iOS and Android that gives gamers a way to easily share their clips on social media. The app allows for sharing from Xbox, Switch, PlayStation and PC for Fortnite users and just Xbox and PlayStation for Epic\u2019s Rocket League. Fortnite users will see the app promoted after an in-game kill, prompting them to download the app so they can share clips. The app was created by Houseparty developer Life on Air, acquired by Epic in 2019. (Houseparty shut down in 2021.) After sharing their first clip from the app, Fortnite users will get special in-game skin, spray and wrap.\nImage Credits: Spillt\nImage Credits: Spillt\nA former Instagram engineer launched a new recipe app called Spillt, covered by The Information, which helps users find, organize and cook recipes \u2014 the latter by helpfully keeping the phone\u2019s screen on during the recipe\u2019s prep. That\u2019s a feature the popular Pestle app also has, along with its voice-powered guided cooking, however. But Spillt\u2019s value proposition is that it offers a way for users to see which recipes their friends are saving in a News Feed of sorts. It remains to be seen if it can actually gain traction amid a sea of recipe apps, but it\u2019s at least differentiated from the set of \u201cTikTok for cooking\u201d apps that are on the market today.","1":"\nA joint venture (JV) between four big European carriers to build cross-network ad-targeting infrastructure \u2014 which they claim will rely on \u201caffirmative\u201d consent to target mobile and\/or fixed network subscribers with \u201cpersonalized\u201d ads across participating brands\/publishers\u2019 sites \u2014 has been given the green light to proceed by the European Commission\u2019s antitrust division in a decision announced Friday.\nThe Commission concluded the transaction between the carriers to create a JV would raise no competition concerns.\nHowever its press release is careful to note that the competition sign-off does not mean the project will pass muster with the EU\u2019s data protection regulators, writing: \u201cDuring its investigation, the Commission has been in contact with data protection authorities. Data protection rules are fully applicable, irrespective of the merger clearance.\u201d\nThe plan is likely to be closely watched from that side as the JV works to launch a commercial ad network targeting European eyeballs \u2014 since data protection regulators and privacy campaigners already raised concerns during a testing phase last year.\nGermany\u2019s Deutsche Telekom, France\u2019s Orange, Spain\u2019s Telefonica and the UK\u2019s Vodafone are the four horsemen involved in the bid to capitalize on high level changes to the third party tracking cookie status quo to spin up ad revenue by creating cross-operator ad-targeting infrastructure focused on first party data.\nThey have said the proposed ad-targeting will rely on explicit consent from mobile and Internet subscribers agreeing that their personal data can be used by a particular brand or advertiser to target them with marketing. Hence they are claiming the adtech infrastructure will be \u201cprivacy led\u201d and will also focus on transparency for consumers in how brands are communicating with them \u2014 in a bid to contrast their approach with the murky world of third party cookie tracking which has been baked into the mainstream web (but is also now in a process of \u2018evolution\u2019 toward something adtech giant Google claims will also be \u201cmore private\u201c).\nUh oh! European carriers are trying to get into \u2018personalized\u2019 ad targeting\n\nFollowing the Commission\u2019s green light on Friday, the quartet of telcos said in a statement they will form a joint venture for \u201cthe implementation of a privacy-by-design digital marketing technology platform in Europe that could benefit consumers, advertisers and publishers alike\u201d \u2014 each taking a 25% stake in the JV company. The latter will be based in Belgium and run by \u201cindependent management under the oversight of a shareholder-appointed supervisory board\u201d, they added.\nDiscussing the cross-network ad-targeting proposal with TechCrunch earlier this year, Vodafone \u2014 which launched the project and led the testing phase last year \u2014 said the plan is for pseudonymized targeting tokens to be linked to a mobile user\u2019s network subscription and shared with participating brands\/publishers without revealing any directly identifiable personal data; and without participating advertisers being able to further sync or enrich data to flesh out fuller profiles. \nIt also specified that the JV will apply contractual limits on advertisers (such as prohibiting special category data from being used for targeting); and conduct regular audits of participants. While it said the system will be engineered so the tokens reset after a period of time to protect against reverse engineering (the initial proposal is for this period to be three months).\nThe \u201caffirmative opt-in\u201d user consent to the tracking and targeting will be sought via pop-ups as mobile users browse the web, per Vodafone. It also told us in January that the plan is for the JV to retain the final say on the language used in these consent pop-ups \u2014 i.e. as another high level check on participants\u2019 behavior.\u00a0\n\u201cThe platform has been designed from the outset to be compliant with European data protection policy such as GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] and the ePrivacy directive,\u201d the four carriers also claimed Friday. \u201cThe partners have already initiated a trial in Germany. Other trials are being considered in France and Spain to further develop the platform and it is intended to make it available to any operator within Europe.\u201d\nWhile the telcos\u2019 subscribers look set to be bothered by a fresh wave of consent pop-ups, Vodafone previously told us users will also be\u00a0able to manage any consents they have given to brands\/publishers via a central portal that will also contain an option letting users block the whole system. \nAlthough it remains to be seen whether finding and flicking a centralized \u2018off switch\u2019 will actually spare carriers\u2019 customers from being mobbed with yet more pop-ups nagging them to turn it back on as they browse the Internet via the connectivity they\u2019re already paying actual money for.\u00a0\nThe quality of the claimed consent and wider issues of legal basis should merit close attention by the EU\u2019s data protection regulators \u2014 who\u2019ve already spent years fumbling a response to the privacy incursions of tracking ads. (Which, in turn, has led to complaints and litigations piling up. And, more recently, to regional lawmakers feeling compelled to step in to force reforms on such widespread law-breaking. So the enforcement gap has by no means been a vacuum.)\nThe plan by European telcos o step into an opportunity gap left by tracking cookies finally reaching the end of the road \u2014 at least so far as \u2018official\u2019 support in Google\u2019s Chrome browser goes (although it\u2019s important to note the adtech giant is working on its own alternative targeting infrastructure, aka its Privacy Sandbox plan) \u2014 is also likely to draw scrutiny from eagle-eyed privacy campaigners. \nSuch as noyb, a not-for-profit that\u2019s gained a reputation for turning modest resources into major privacy wins over the last few years and has made tracking-ads (and their cynically non-compliant \u2018consent\u2019 pop-ups) a big area of focus for action in recent years \u2014 putting the squeeze on some of the most egregious episodes of adtech data-theft and dark patterns. \nAny fresh wave of telco-powered pop-ups would \u2014 therefore \u2014 present a compelling target for fresh legal complaints. (A spokeswoman for noyb told us it\u2019s looking at the JV project and has not yet taken any decisions on any actions it may take.)\nFor now, there\u2019s no launch timeline attached to the telcos\u2019 \u201ctechnological solution for digital advertising in Europe\u201d, as they bill the tracking ads redux plan.\nOn Friday all they said on that front was that the JV will \u201coutline its vision and strategy in due course, including its plans for adopting the trial technology commercially\u201d.\nIt\u2019s possible more public discussion will emerge at the upcoming GSMA Mobile World Congress (MWC) conference, which kicks off later this month in Barcelona, where reps from all four telcos are scheduled to speak at a number of keynotes and panel discussion sessions. Although they may also opt for a quieter route \u2014 via in-person networking and closed door meetings \u2014 to further their goal of scaling participation to carriers all over Europe.\nOffering a preview of how the four founding telcos might pitch the adtech infrastructure to regional peers, in their statement on Friday they wrote: \u201cThe trial platform requires affirmative opt-in consent by the consumer to activate communications from brands via publishers. The only data that is shared is a pseudo-anonymous digital token that cannot be reverse-engineered. Consumers are free to opt in or deny consent with a single click, as well as revoke any other consents given either on the brand\u2019s or publisher\u2019s website, or via a dedicated, easily accessible privacy portal.\u201d\nMaking a tacit swipe at US adtech giants like Google, they added: \u201cThe platform is specifically designed to offer consumers a step change in the control, transparency and protection of their data, which is currently collected, distributed and stored at scale by major, non-European players.\u201d\nEuropean carriers file to create joint venture for opt-in ad targeting of mobile users\n\nEU watchdogs agree on how to handle certain cookie consent dark patterns\n\nUK privacy watchdog silent as Google flicks off critique that its Topics API fails to reform ad-tracking\n","2":"\nApp Store might suggest you a useful app from time to time, but you can\u2019t rely on that to discover new apps. Places like Reddit communities or Product Hunt could also be very broad for what you are looking for.\nSo a team of engineers at Basedash, a startup that helps companies connect their databases to admin panels, made a product called Dockhunt that lets you discover new Mac apps by looking at docks.\nThe idea is simple: people post their Mac docks on the site and others can look at them like they are exploring their own dock.\u00a0 The Dockhunt site also has a list of top apps that shows how many users have that app pinned in their docks. The app makers told TechCrunch that they are considering putting a filter that will weed out popular apps like Chrome, Slack, and Spotify so users can discover indie apps.\nFloored by the response to @dockhuntapp since launching this morning.\nOf course, we're using @Basedash as an internal admin panel to manage app information and to feature docks on the home page. pic.twitter.com\/L5BDEHXlEW\n\u2014 Max Musing (@MaxMusing) January 31, 2023\n\nThe team at Basedash said that designer Tom Johnson had the idea of creating a tool that lets users browse a Mac dock on the web. A few engineers pitched in to build Dockhunt, which was eventually released late last month.\nIf you want to post your own dock, you will have to download the Dockhunt app and run it. Alternatively, you can also use a command line method to post the dock. Notably, Dockhunt only captures pinned apps and not apps that are open but don\u2019t have a permanent spot in your dock. At the time of writing, more than 1,100 people had posted their docks on the site.\nCurrently, the site shows the dock with the username or Twitter handle. The Dockhunt team is also considering a mode that will let people post their docks anonymously.","3":"\nThe Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation.\u00a0Sign up here \u2014\u00a0just click The Station\u00a0\u2014 to receive the full edition of the newsletter every weekend in your inbox.

Indeed, the company launched a new trail sports option last year, then a few weeks back it announced that it had acquired a European startup called Fatmap, which has created a 3D mapping platform for mountains. Strava is planning to integrate Fatmap into its core platform in the coming months.\nWhenever there\u2019s a changing of the guard at a big venture-backed tech company, this often signals something major is coming up on the horizon.

Today, however, NeevaAI is officially rolling out internationally to logged-in users, including Canada, the U.K., Germany, France, and Spain. Additionally, the Neeva search engine itself (not NeevaAI) will be rolling out to Australia and New Zealand.\nThe timing of today\u2019s announcement is particularly notable, coming a week after Microsoft reignited the search engine wars with the introduction of ChatGPT to its Bing search engine and, with it, the promise of a completely reimagined search experience.\nMost years can pretty much be defined by at least one over-arching tech trend. In 2022, web3 was one of the big buzzwords in town, with the metaverse and tangential immersive technologies also jostling for mindshare. While there is nothing to indicate that such trends will wither any time soon, it\u2019s clear from the first six weeks of the new year that generative AI will be the big talking point of 2023.\nGenerative AI, essentially, describes the process of using algorithms to create (\u201cgenerate\u201d) new content. The poster child of this movement is ChatGPT, a chatbot-style technology trained on large language models (LLMs) capable of producing scarily good (but far from flawless) work such as essays, articles, poems, lyrics, and even computer programs. The handiwork of OpenAI, a Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence (AI) research body, ChatGPT has taken the world by storm since its prototype was first introduced back in November, with some arguing that its launch signals AI\u2019s arrival into the mainstream.\nWith OpenAI already commercializing the service through a premium subscription, the mighty Google last week scrambled into action to unveil a new \u201cexperimental conversational AI service\u201d called Bard, showcasing how AI might transform search engines by powering synthesized responses collated from multiple sources to provide more nuanced answers to online queries. And that is what Microsoft actually launched two days later \u2014 an all-new incarnation of Bing powered by a more advanced version of ChatGPT, customized for real-time search.\nRather than serving the usual laddered list of links, the new AI-infused search engine takes a request, scans for answers, and generates a response replete with citations to the original sources.\nThe new AI-infused Bing search engine in action Image Credits: Microsoft\nThe new AI-infused Bing search engine in action Image Credits: Microsoft\nAnd this, effectively, is what Neeva is now bringing to international markets, a month on from its U.S. launch.\nBy way of a brief recap, Mountain View, California-based Neeva first launched a subscription-only search engine in its domestic U.S. market in June 2021, and later went on to add a free \u201cbasic\u201d tier to the mix with certain restrictions in place. The company brought the search engine to Europe back in October, and has since rolled it out to additional markets around the world.\nNeeva\u2019s core selling point is that it doesn\u2019t monetize through advertising, and it prevents third-party trackers from using personal data to display personalized ads \u2014 Neeva wants to make money through good old-fashioned paid subscriptions.\nAn ad-free search environment means that users don\u2019t have to scroll through myriad sponsored results to get to the organic links they want. However, Neeva\u2019s basic look-and-feel is much the same as search engines have been since before even Google arrived on the scene \u2014 row after row of links to individual sources, with a few aesthetic deviations thrown into the mix.\nNeeva: Only organic search results Image Credits: Neeva\nNeeva: Only organic search results Image Credits: Neeva\nBut with NeevaAI, the startup is looking to do its part in reinvent search.\nTechCrunch has been dabbling with NeevaAI over the past few weeks, and from our tests it performed pretty impressively, comfortably handling questions such as \u201cWhy were the Beatles so big?\u201d or \u201cWhat is the world 5k [running] record?,\u201d with Neeva generating a response from multiple cited sources in real time.\nThese citations are key to avoiding the \u201cblack box\u201d controversies that engulf many AI technologies. The idea here is that by showing people where it\u2019s sourcing its information from, this not only promotes transparency, but also give those who have published content to the web the credit they deserve and increases their chances of follow-on referral traffic.\nNeevaAI in action Image Credits: TechCrunch\nNeevaAI in action Image Credits: TechCrunch\nBut some questions it simply isn\u2019t equipped to deal with. In those cases, it defaults to the familiar website-specific links and excerpts for users to peruse and figure out the answer for themselves.\nNeeva returning normal results Image Credits: TechCrunch\nNeeva returning normal results Image Credits: TechCrunch\nIn an interview with TechCrunch for this story, Ramaswamy explained some of the rationale that went into developing NeevaAI, including how it decides when and where to generate answers from multiple sources.\n\u201cRoughly speaking, it works for questions that we can find authority websites that answer that question,\u201d Ramaswamy explained.\nSo, unlike many of the quirky examples we\u2019ve seen so far of ChatGPT being tasked with writing lyrics in the style of Nick Cave, for instance, NeevaAI won\u2019t help you here. Likewise, if you ask it a trick question \u2014 deliberately or otherwise \u2014 it likely won\u2019t return an answer, reverting to the usual list of links for you to research yourself.\n\u201cOur goal with NeevaAI was to \u2014 first and foremost \u2014 be fail-safe, we don\u2019t want to be telling you incorrect things,\u201d Ramaswamy continued. \u201cSo we opted for safety in how we retrieve (information).\u201d\nAn example here might be if someone was to ask NeevaAI when Boris Johnson served as the King of the United Kingdom, rather than the more accurate question of when he served as Prime Minister. It\u2019s the sort of question that could potentially trick any search engine, because there will undoubtedly be pages on the internet that contain all the words in the question \u2014 so the onus is very much on NeevaAI to ensure that it understands the question, and gives an appropriate response. Or no response at all, which is what it will do with questions where it\u2019s not confident of the answer.\nNeevaAI refusing to answer a question Image Credits: TechCrunch\nNeevaAI refusing to answer a question Image Credits: TechCrunch\nClearly, NeevaAI\u2019s response here isn\u2019t perfect. A smarter response \u2014 one that a human would undoubtedly deliver \u2014 would be to tell the user that Boris Johnson wasn\u2019t in fact the King, but he did serve as Prime Minister. Or at the very least, generate a more satisfactory response that steers the user to refine the question. And this is something that could come to NeevaAI in a future iteration, though what form this ultimately takes isn\u2019t clear.\n\u201cIf you ask it some some silly question, it\u2019s just not going to say anything because there\u2019s nothing on the web that suggests that this is true or false,\u201d Ramaswamy said. \u201cSo when there\u2019s not an answer to be had, we decline to answer. But we will be fixing that soon.\u201d\nTechCrunch\u2019s conversation with Ramaswamy took place before Bing\u2019s big reveal last week, so today\u2019s expansion into global markets has a slightly different feel to it than it might\u2019ve done prior to the knowledge that Microsoft was basically doing the same thing \u2014 with billions more dollars in its coffers to help. And it\u2019s clear now that Google will be doing something similar in the future.\nElsewhere, other search engine upstarts are following a similar trajectory to that of Neeva. Back in December, venture-backed You.com launched similar ChatGPT-style AI smarts to that of Neeva.\nIt\u2019s clear that Neeva has its work cut out if it\u2019s to differentiate in a market that includes long-established billion-dollar incumbents, and other agile startups, with much the same goals. However, Neeva is hopeful that its ad-free approach will win it enough supporters to see it flourish more generally as a search engine, at a time when the world has grown increasingly weary of big tech\u2019s big data harnessing. The likes of You.com doesn\u2019t yet deliver ads, but it has said it may offer \u201cnon-privacy invading\u201d ads in the future.\nBut more than all that, Neeva is betting on its future by developing its own search stack, rather than leaning on the same engine used by Google or Microsoft\u2019s Bing, as most other challengers do.\nNone of this is to say, however, that Neeva is an entirely independent, self-sufficient entity. While it is pushing toward relying entirely on its own search stack, for now it does lean on Bing for some web search activity. And specific to NeevaAI, Ramaswamy confirmed that it works with \u201clarge language model companies\u201d including OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5 and Claude from the heavily-venture backed Anthropic, which was founded by former OpenAI employees.\n\u201cWe use them for things like generating training data for us, and sometimes we will make calls to them to help with the summaries,\u201d Ramaswamy said. \u201cMost models we use for NeevaAI are our own \u2014 we pre-train or fine-tune them for custom tasks like question-answering or summarization.\u201d\nFounded four years ago, Neeva has taken on some $77.5 million in venture capital funding from Silicon Valley VC heavyweights including Sequoia Capital and Greylock. So while it is up against the likes of Google and Microsoft, among other well-funded startups, it\u2019s not exactly without friends and finances itself.\nIrrespective of where Neeva goes from here, it\u2019s clear that 2023 is shaping up to be a big year for generative AI, evidenced by the likes of Shutterstock\u2019s recently-launched toolkit for creating stock images based on text prompts.\nSimilarly, Neeva has no plans to limit the scope of its AI endeavors to simple search engine-based information retrieval, and is likely to expand into related verticals in the future.\n\u201cVivek [Neeva co-founder Vivek Raghunathan] and I are like kids in a candy shop, we don\u2019t know what to work on next,\u201d Ramaswamy joked. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much \u2014 simple, natural follow-on things. Generative AI is one direction, doing site-specific search is another super-interesting direction. These are things that are easily adjacent to what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\nNeevaAI is available today in English for logged-in users on both the free and premium plans in the U.K. and Canada, as well as local language incarnations in Germany, France, and Spain.","6":"\nQotto, a solar kits provider with operations in Burkina Faso and Benin, has raised $8 million in a Series A equity-debt round led by the IBL group, a billion-dollar conglomerate headquartered in Mauritius with business interests in a number of sectors including energy, financial services, logistics, distribution, and engineering.\nThe Off-Grid Energy Access Fund (FEI-OGEF), Cordaid, and Qotto\u2019s existing investors also participated in the round.\nQotto told TechCrunch it plans to scale in existing markets, and expand to Ivory Coast where it is set to begin operations by next month.\nSun King raises $260M to widen clean energy access in Africa, Asia\n\nFounded in 2016, Qotto designs and distributes stand-alone solar kits and lanterns to individuals residing in the least electrified regions of Africa. Through a pay-to-own model , it avails its products to individuals in Sub-Saharan Africa that are off-grid owing to underdeveloped national power grids.\n\u201cFor Ivory Coast, due to its consistent pace of development relative to the broader West Africa region, and after having tested and optimized operations and services in Benin and Burkina Faso, Qotto is well prepared for a market entry. Moreover, the customers who have been able to test the Qotto products in the country, have expressed a need and desire to see Qotto enter the Ivory Coast market,\u201d said Qotto co-founder and president, Jean-Baptiste Lenoir.\nQotto says IBL is drawing its roadmap for East Africa expansion too, after signing a partnership and agreeing to offer off-grid solutions in the region. The expansion, to take place by September this year, will happen alongside that of IBL, which is planning to \u201cto strengthen its position in East Africa and to develop its renewable energies exposure.\u201d\n\u201cTogether, we see a great opportunity for the essential services and large Solar Home Systems offerings provided by Qotto,\u201d said Lenoir.\nThe growth bid follows the planned introduction of new products in the market, including financial services and internet access hotspots, as Qotto evolves into an all-rounded essential services operator.\n\u201cOur edge is that our presence in rural areas allows us to understand the customers and their needs so that we can propose innovative products based on our technical platform,\u201d he said.\nThe planned financial services include micro-insurance, micro-credit and micro-savings products, designed in collaboration with partners such as SUNU, a large insurer in West Africa. Qotto said it has already sold thousands of life insurance contracts.\nThe internet hotspots will be located in high-foot traffic areas like the shops, restaurants or bars.\n\u201cIn sub-Saharan Africa, 650M people do not have access to electricity. 550M do not have access to the Internet and 800M do not have access to financial services. Many of these customers are overlapping in their needs for off-grid solutions, connectivity and financial services,\u201d said Lenoir\n\u201cOur model helps to solve these critical issues under a single solution \u2013 which we call \u201cessential services\u201d, backed by our proprietary technology stack. In addition, we are aligned with the SDGs to serve customers and improve impact indicators in our markets,\u201d he said.\nRenewable energy solutions by companies like Qotto are bridging the energy access gap in the least electrified countries like South Sudan, Burundi, Chad, Malawi, Burkina Faso, Madagascar and Tanzania, all located in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 75% of the world\u2019s population with no access electricity.\nQotto says its revenue has grown 50% year on year, and that it had 11,000 active customers by the end of last year, which it plans to more than double by the close of this year following its growth plans.\nKenya\u2019s growth was strongest in Africa\u2019s VC market; clean tech, e-commerce pulled in most of the funding\n\nSeven scaleups hog over 70% of funding to Africa\u2019s solar pay-go ventures\n\nCrossBoundary gets $25M for solar mini-grids in Africa\n\n.","7":"\nThe public transport sector in Kenya is largely traditional and a majority of operators, especially those in road travel, still require their clients to physically book tickets at their offices even when making advance travel plans. Others do not have provisions for seat reservation.\nLooking to bridge the gap, booking platforms are emerging in the space, including BuuPass, which is actively looking to promote order in the highly-fragmented sector by helping operators to digitize their operations.\nThe company, which was founded in Kenya seven years ago, plans to first scale in Kenya and Uganda, before exploring other markets backed by a $1.3 million pre-seed funding it has raised from the Founders Factory Africa, FrontEnd Ventures, Adaverse, Gullit, Five35, Renew Capital, Changecom, XA Network, Ajim Capital, Artha Ventures, Daba Finance, Google Black Founders Fund, and several angel investors.\n\u201cThe funding will enable us to invest in growth activities, increasing our market share in East Africa, with a focus on Kenya and Uganda. We will hire a team especially on the growth side, and technology experts so that we can build systems for scale because our plan is to become a pan-African infrastructure for long distance transportation,\u201d said co-CEO, Sonia Kabra, who co-founded BuuPass with Wycliffe Omondi in 2016.\nBuuPass, a B2B2C full-stack marketplace, provides operators with a bus management system (BMS) for managing their operations, inventory and sales. It then connects them to its marketplace, where passengers search, compare and book their tickets using different channels, including websites, apps, and USSD codes.\nThe BMS includes a point-of-sale solution to capture transactions, and to provide access to a parcel management module.\nBuuPass says operators using its BMS are able to manage their fleets and businesses better, gain access to data they can use to draw insights from, and reduce cash leakages, while increasing their sales from online bookings.\nThe company says it processes about 12,000 transactions per day across its booking channels, and has recorded over 9 million ticket sales so far. Its Gross Merchandise Value was slightly over $30 million in 2022.\nIt supports a total fleet size of 1,200 vehicles from over 25 bus companies, including one of the oldest, Easy Coach. Travelers can also book flight and train tickets, especially bringing convenience to travelers using the country\u2019s railway network for intercity travel.\nIn Kenya, BuuPass, in partnership with Safaricom, the parent-company of mobile money service M-Pesa, clinched the contract to facilitate train bookings in 2017.\n\u201cPartnering with Safaricom enabled us to land the Kenya Railways (operators of the national train grid) deal and validated our solution and capacity to build solutions for high value transactions. It also enabled us to build trust in the market, and helped us think about scale such that we have developed solutions capable of handling millions of transactions and providing a seamless experience for the end user. It\u2019s been a great validation for us to prove our credibility in the market,\u201d said Kabra.\nSonia and Omondi met in 2013 at the Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, US, and their interest in entrepreneurship and pursuit to provide solutions for the transport sector in emerging markets, saw them co-found the college\u2019s first entrepreneurship club, and BuuPass. In 2016, they won the $1 million Hult Prize, a grant backed by Bill Clinton that helped them launch BuuPass (known as Magic Bus Ticketing then) in Kenya as a B2C platform.\nHowever, they quickly realized that the idea was not feasible as the operations of most bus companies were overwhelmingly manual, hence the need to prioritize digitization.\n\u201cWe went deeper into the market, and saw that there was a bigger problem with the bus operators; they were mostly using pen and paper to do ticketing, they had no transparency into their sales. There were a lot of cash leakages, and they were not able to digitize and access the users who are coming online every day. And so, we built a bus management system for them,\u201d said Kabra.","8":"\nXiaomi \u2014 the company that originally made its name as \u201cthe Apple of China\u201d \u2014 broke out of its home market and became a household name in India shortly after its debut in 2014. Its initial, rapid success was with phones, but that gave Chinese company the velocity to take on other product categories, where it became a big player in wearables, smart TVs and IoT devices. Within two years, it was even investing in Indian startups and making a move into consumer lending services.\nBut now, as Beijing-based Xiaomi approaches its ninth year in the country with 200 million smartphones shipped, its earlier mover advantages are eroding: it lost its top position in smartphone shipments in Q4 2022; it faces regulatory pressure in the country amid growing economic tensions between China and India; and it\u2019s wound down some of its newer business ventures. On top of all that, Xiaomi is seeing an exodus of executives in India.\nCounterpoint Research numbers from January show that Xiaomi\u2019s India smartphone shipments in 2022 declined 24% year-on-year. It managed to keep its top position in 2022 overall, but signs are looking dicey for 2023: Xiaomi dropped to third place in Q4, behind Samsung and Chinese competitor Vivo.\nCanalys also showed a similar drop, along with a 40% decline in Xiaomi\u2019s annual growth in Q4. The company additionally saw a 26% drop in its annual growth in full-year 2022, per the analyst firm.\nXiaomi lost its leadership in smartphone shipments in Q4 2022 Image Credit: Canalys\nXiaomi lost its leadership in smartphone shipments in Q4 2022 Image Credit: Canalys\nIDC also showed a 38%+ dip in the company\u2019s growth in Q4, though the research firm said that the smartphone maker maintained its lead in the market.\nXiaomi\u2019s decline in India is not an isolated phenomenon.

Market analysts attribute this trend mainly to low demand for entry-level smartphones, broader macroeconomic challenges such as high inflation and rising unemployment rates. The global smartphone market has also experienced a slowdown.\nDespite these macro challenges, Xiaomi\u2019s rise and fall and current hurdles are a unique story in the Indian market.\nIn July 2014, Xiaomi entered India with a bang, a bold move at a time when it was largely known for its Apple-inspired products in China. The brand name is difficult to pronounce among local customers, but even so, the company quickly made a name for itself in the South Asian market.\nThe firm\u2019s phones punched above their weight, and it managed to significantly undercut the incumbent\u2019s offerings. And to save costs, Xiaomi opted to not spend on building its supply chain operations and instead partnered with Amazon India and Flipkart to leverage their distribution channels.\nAdded to this was the local economic climate: India was experiencing remarkable growth, moving away from being a massive market for feature phones with an increasing number of young, tech-savvy consumers with a new appetite for low-cost smartphone brands.\nOppo and others were also making moves, but Xiaomi\u00a0rose to the top and stayed there, overtaking Samsung and local players Micromax, Karbonn Mobiles and Lava.\nOn the back of that, Xiaomi expanded its presence in India by introducing non-smartphone products and establishing brick-and-mortar stores, a crucial move in a market where offline retail still largely dominates.\nThat market entry was also buffered with a charismatic leader. In late 2013, Manu Kumar Jain, who had built his fashion e-commerce startup Jabong which was later sold to Flipkart, was looking to start a hardware startup. To raise money, he went to China, where he met Hugo Barra, Xiaomi\u2019s then vice president, and learned about Xiaomi\u2019s plan to enter the Indian market, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nBarra \u2014 a flashy hire in his own right, coming from a high profile role at Google \u2014 was tasked with expanding Xiaomi beyond China. He saw great potential in India, which already had some Chinese players such as Oppo and Vivo \u2014 alongside local vendors. Jain was Xiaomi\u2019s first executive in India.\nIn 2014, Barra and Jain led a launch event in New Delhi, playing a visible role in establishing Xiaomi\u2019s foothold in a market. This was important not least because anti-China sentiments have long run high due to tensions with the neighboring nation.\nBut the company won over a loyal customer base, which it affectionately referred to as \u201cMi Fans.\u201d Mi Fans eagerly participated in every new Xiaomi phone launch in the country and helped the company\u2019s PR team by promoting its new online and offline releases.\nThen in 2017, things started to shift.\nBarra suddenly resigned from his position to join Facebook. The move disappointed Xiaomi\u2019s loyal customers, but it meant even more prominence for Jain, who Xiaomi promoted to the role of managing director in 2018 to oversee the company\u2019s operations in India.\nJain quickly filled the void left by Barra\u2019s departure and became a poster boy for the company, interacting with local media, distributors, and fans, and serving as a bridge between the company\u2019s top-level management in China and its counterpart in India.\nHugo Barra was a key face at Xiaomi launches in India and around the globe Image Credit: MONEY SHARMA\/AFP via Getty Images\nHugo Barra was a key face at Xiaomi launches in India and around the globe Image Credit: MONEY SHARMA\/AFP via Getty Images\nYet in July 2021, Jain moved quietly from Bengaluru to Dubai, and the company changed Jain\u2019s designation from managing director to director in November and appointed Muralikrishnan B, the then-chief operating officer, as a director, according to the regulatory filings. In February 2022, Jain resigned from his director position in India.\nA few months later, other details started to emerge that spoke to deeper issues the company had in India.\nIn April 2022, Jain was summoned by India\u2019s financial crime-fighting agency, the Enforcement Directorate. Xiaomi\u2019s India office was also reportedly raided over an alleged tax evasion case in late 2021. The agency seized assets worth around $725 million from Xiaomi for violating the country\u2019s foreign exchange laws. The company responded by stating that over 84% of the seized amount was royalty payments made to Qualcomm Group.\nThese events hit at the company\u2019s image with customers, distributors and retailers. In response, Xiaomi\u2019s board in India held an extraordinary general meeting, sources tell us, to declare its financial compliance with Indian authorities. Regulatory filings from the time show the company amended its legal incorporation and association documents to reflect that.\nIn June 2022, Xiaomi replaced Jain with Alvin Tse as the new India general manager. Tse was likely seen as a safe bet: most recently he had been leading operations in Indonesia but Tse had long familiarity with Xiaomi in India as one of the early architects of its strategy there, an investor in Indian startups, and a founding member of Xiaomi\u2019s sub-brand Poco (later\u00a0spun out as an independent business). The company also brought back Anuj Sharma \u2014 who\u2019d been overseeing the operations at Poco India \u2014 as its CMO.\nA Xiaomi India spokesperson told TechCrunch in a written response that the changes were \u201cundertaken to streamline its focus areas and strategy.\u201d In line with this, Muralikrishnan B. was also promoted as the president of India operations, the spokesperson said.\nBut the management changes did not help retain top talent. Key departures in 2022 included CMO Jaskaran Singh Kapany, offline sales operations director Sunil Baby, and chief business officer Raghu Reddy. Jain also eventually left the company in January, saying he would take some time off before considering his next move.\nFormer employees said multiple factors pushed top-level executives to leave the company.\nXiaomi\u2019s compensation in India is known to be poor relative to rivals. One former executive said the salaries of middle and senior management employees at Xiaomi are between 40-50% lower compared to Oppo, Vivo, OnePlus, and Samsung. That resulted in high attrition.\nDespite that, Jain created a \u201cstartup culture\u201d that still attracted strong talent.\nManu Kumar Jain became the poster boy for Xiaomi India Image Credit: Indranil Bhoumik\/Mint via Getty Images\nManu Kumar Jain became the poster boy for Xiaomi India Image Credit: Indranil Bhoumik\/Mint via Getty Images\n\u201cCulturally, to me, Xiaomi was much, much higher than any organization I have known or worked with. Xiaomi was very clear about what they wanted to do, and maybe to a large extent because of Manu,\u201d another former Xiaomi executive told TechCrunch, who did not want to be named.\nBut that also crashed after Jain left his position. Tse\u2019s appointment was especially disappointing for top-level employees, who saw it as a sign that their career progression would be limited, one source said.\n\u201cInstead of just a horizontal movement, we could have looked into more vertical movement and [been] given more responsibilities,\u201d the former executive said. \u201cThat would have played out differently.\u201d\nThe Xiaomi India spokesperson responded to questions regarding the recent exits and said its attrition rate had been at par or lower than the industry average. The spokesperson also replied on the query about giving relatively low employee compensation by saying that the salaries offered to its employees were in line with industry benchmarks and competitive and \u201cincluded a combination of fixed and variable pay along with other benefits.\u201d\n\u201cAt Xiaomi India, many of our senior executives and employees have been associated with us for a long time and have made valuable contributions to the company\u2019s growth. That being said, there can be cases where people want to pursue fresh career adventures after many years,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nBarra and Jain managed to localize Xiaomi\u2019s operations in India though ultimate control came from China. In 2015, the company started local manufacturing of its devices in partnership with Foxconn. It pronounced the local manufacturing as a move to support the Indian government\u2019s Make in India initiative. This was used as a marketing strategy to convince customers who were avoiding Xiaomi devices due to its linkage with China, which had strained bilateral ties with India. Local manufacturing also helped the company cut import tariffs and stand for getting incentives for exporting locally-manufactured phones. The company later expanded the manufacturing to newer devices, locations and partners.\nThe recent supply chain challenges also did not impact Xiaomi in India as it sourced components from multiple suppliers. Additionally, the company effectively manages its stock keeping units (SKUs) by making minor design changes and selling similar models under different names.\nIt went all smoothly for Xiaomi until 2020 \u2014 shortly after the rise in anti-China sentiment in India over a skirmish between armies of the two nations in June. The Indian government then banned hundreds of China-linkage apps, which included Xiaomi\u2019s Mi Community and Mi Browser apps. The company also disabled its Mi Community website.\nDisabling Mi Community, which served as a one-stop destination for Xiaomi\u2019s customers, impacted the company as it had millions of users from India who would directly engage with moderators and software teams assigned by the company. It also offered the company a space to talk about its marketing moves and communicate its product launch plans and software updates.\nAlongside the ban on Mi Community, some Xiaomi stores received vandalism threats due to growing discontent. The company\u2019s shipments coming from China were also halted at Indian ports for rigorous inspection.\nAnti-China sentiment in India reached new heights in 2020 Image Credit: SAM PANTHAKY\/AFP via Getty Images\nAnti-China sentiment in India reached new heights in 2020 Image Credit: SAM PANTHAKY\/AFP via Getty Images\nThe company also began to hide Xiaomi\u2019s native \u2018Mi\u2019 branding from its stores with a banner carrying a \u201cMade in India\u201d label.\nXiaomi was not alone in facing criticism over its China connection. Other Chinese companies such as Vivo and Oppo also met similar behavior in the country. But as the biggest brand, Xiaomi got the most attention.\nIn 2021, Xiaomi introduced as many as 17 smartphone models at different price points, and in 2022 it bumped that up to 18 models.\nThis was a major step change for Xiaomi. The company\u2019s initial strategy was to launch one \u201csuper-hit\u201d model every quarter to keep people buzzing about the company, said a former Xiaomi executive. The newer approach offering more choice, ironically, was a miscall. Inventory piled up.\n\u201cThe biggest challenge for Xiaomi has been to understand the pace of the market,\u201d said Tarun Pathak, research director for devices and ecosystems at Counterpoint Research. That includes better tracking and deals on its stock across its whole ecosystem of devices, but also more 5G models.\nXiaomi has smartwatches and other devices in its ecosystem Image Credit: Wang Gang \/ Costfoto\/Future Publishing via Getty Images\nXiaomi has smartwatches and other devices in its ecosystem Image Credit: Wang Gang \/ Costfoto\/Future Publishing via Getty Images\nNotably, the Xiaomi spokesperson said the company has a \u201ccleaner portfolio\u201d this year, a cornerstone to building back its position.\n\u201c2022 has been a challenging year in more ways than one,\u201d admitted the spokesperson, but countered that its \u201cstrong brand\u201d would help see this through. \u201cWe have kickstarted 2023 with an extremely successful launch of our most loved Redmi Note series. We will continue to delight our consumers with products that suit their requirements and enhance the overall experience.\u201d\nBut high inventory issues will take a while to even out. Market analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimated that the company\u2019s smartphone shipments globally in 2023 would decrease by 8\u201310% year-on-year to 140 million.\n\u201cXiaomi\u2019s production plans for smartphones in 1Q23 and 2Q23 are still weak, with estimates of only 23\u201325 million and 20\u201323 million units, respectively. There are no signs of significant improvement in Xiaomi\u2019s production plan for 3Q23,\u201d he said, adding that its smartphone and component inventory was around 40\u201350 million, equivalent to 12\u201316 weeks, significantly more than six weeks, considered a healthy inventory level.\nBut even so, Navkendar Singh, associate vice president at IDC India, noted that it\u2019s too soon to conclude that Xiaomi is losing ground in the country.\n\u201cIt\u2019s slightly premature to say that Xiaomi has thrown in the towel,\u201d he said.","9":"\nAt a time when venture capital funding is slowing in China, EV is one of the few sectors that are still keeping investors excited. Case in point, Zeekr, the luxury electric vehicle brand of China\u2019s largest private carmaker Geely, announced Monday that investors have committed to investing $750 million in its Series A funding round. Its post-money valuation has shot up to $13 billion.\nThe news comes just two months after Zeekr said it had confidentially filed for an initial public offering in the U.S. At the time, Reuters reported that the electric carmaker was seeking over $1 billion in proceeds at a valuation of more than $10 billion. TechCrunch has reached out to Zeekr regarding its IPO status.\nInvestors who have agreed to back Zeekr in its Series A include a few heavyweights like Mobileye\u2019s founder and CEO Amnon Shashua, Chinese battery giant and Tesla supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL), China\u2019s state-owned Yuexiu Industrial Fund, Tongshang Fund and Xin\u2019an Intelligent Manufacturing Fund, another Chinese state-owned investment vehicle.\nProceeds from the raise will support Zeekr\u2019s technology research and global expansion. Indeed, the firm has been aggressively ramping up its international footprint. In January, my colleague Kirsten wrote that the company had some 3,000 open positions in more than 30 cities around the world, including at its R&D center in Ningbo and Shanghai in China, and Gothenburg, Sweden. The young carmaker was also opening an office in Silicon Valley.\nFounded in March 2021, Zeekr landed its first external funding round in August of that year. The investment totaled $500 million from a list of strategic investors, including Intel Capital, Intel\u2019s corporate VC arm, CATL, Chinese user-generated video site Bilibili, Chinese private equity fund Cathay Fortune Group, of which founder Yu Yong\u2019s holding company is a major shareholder in CATL, and storied Chinese private equity firm Boyu Capital, an investor in Ant Group.\nGeely\u2019s electric car brand Zeekr files US IPO confidentially\n\n","10":"\nSafety advocacy group The Dawn Project is taking its campaign to ban Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system to the Super Bowl.\nThe 30-second ad, which is broadcasting to millions of football fans in Washington D.C. and state capitals like Austin, Tallahassee, Albany, Atlanta and Sacramento, outlines several alleged critical safety defects of Tesla FSD, the automaker\u2019s advanced driver assistance system (ADAS).\nFSD is not actually fully self-driving, although it can perform some automated driving tasks like maneuvering through city streets and highways without driver input. The $15,000 system isn\u2019t perfect, though, and drivers must remain alert to take over in case the system malfunctions or comes across something it can\u2019t handle. There have been several reports of accidents occurring while Autopilot, Tesla\u2019s lower level ADAS, was engaged. As a result, Tesla has been criticized, investigated and sued for falsely marketing the capabilities of its automated driving systems.\nThis most recent critique comes as Tesla has recently released its latest version of FSD to around 400,000 drivers in North America, renewing concerns of the system\u2019s safety. Last month, a Tesla engineer testified that a 2016 demo in which the company claimed its car was driving itself was actually staged.\nThe Super Bowl ad features a collection of incriminating videos of Teslas behaving erratically while a voice over claims FSD will \u201crun down a child in a school crosswalk, swerve into oncoming traffic, hit a baby in a stroller, go straight past stopped school buses, ignore \u2018do not enter\u2019 signs, and even drive on the wrong side of the road.\u201d\nThe Dawn Project asserts that Tesla\u2019s \u201cdeceptive marketing\u201d and \u201cwoefully inept engineering\u201d is endangering the public, and calls on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Department of Motor vehicles to turn off FSD until all of the safety defects are fixed.\nThe Dawn Project\u2019s founder, Dan O\u2019Dowd, is also the CEO of Green Hill Software, a company that builds operating systems for embedded safety and security systems, as well as its own automated driving systems. That fact at once lends credence to the organization\u2019s potential subject matter expertise, and makes it clear that Green Hill is in competition with Tesla\u2019s FSD. Last year, The Dawn Project took out a full page ad in The New York Times claiming Tesla\u2019s FSD has a \u201ccritical malfunction every eight minutes.\u201d\nO\u2019Dowd, who ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate last November and lost, says he\u2019s making the investment in the new ad campaign because he wants to put pressure on politicians to prioritize ADAS safety. Some politicians like Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) have called for more oversight on Tesla\u2019s tech, but the issue hasn\u2019t exactly gone mainstream.\nAfter The Dawn Project aired a commercial last summer showing a Tesla Model 3 striking four different child-sized mannequins while driving a test track in California, Tesla sent the organization a cease-and-desist letter. The letter refuted all of the campaign\u2019s claims, doubled down on Tesla\u2019s commitment to safety and called to question The Dawn Project\u2019s methodology.\n\u201cThe purported tests misuse and misrepresent the capabilities of Tesla\u2019s technology, and disregard widely recognized testing performed by independent agencies as well as the experiences shared by our customers,\u201d wrote Dinna Eskin, a Tesla lawyer, in last year\u2019s cease-and-desist. \u201cIn fact, unsolicited scrutiny of the methodology behind The Dawn Project\u2019s tests has already (and within hours of you publicly making defamatory allegations) shown that the testing is seriously deceptive and likely fraudulent.\u201d\nTesla supporters also rushed to defend the technology, including one investor who tested the FSD beta using his own kid. O\u2019Dowd offered to run the test with Musk and other critics in person to prove the accuracy and methodology of his tests.\n\u201cTesla continues to focus on features and marketing gimmicks, not fixing critical safety defects,\u201d said O\u2019Dowd in a statement.\u201dElon even stated that Tesla\u2019s priorities were Smart Summon, Autopark and Optimus, not making sure that FSD will not run down children. It is clear that the priorities at Tesla are wrong, and it is time for the regulator to step in and switch the software off until all of the issues we have identified are fixed.\u201d\nTesla hasn\u2019t responded publicly to the Super Bowl ad, but CEO Elon Musk replied to a tweet showing the ad with the Rolling on the Floor Laughing emoji. Tesla disbanded its PR department in 2020, so TechCrunch couldn\u2019t reach out for a comment.\nIn addition to the Super Bowl ad, The Dawn Project is also taking out a series of full page ads in Politico and running additional TV ads in Washington, D.C., \u201cwhere regulators are located,\u201d that will call on FSD to be disabled until critical safety defects are fixed.\nDOJ requests Autopilot, FSD documents from Tesla\n","11":"\nWelcome to\u00a0The Interchange!

This will include everything from funding rounds to trends to an analysis of a particular space to hot takes on a particular company or phenomenon. There\u2019s a lot of fintech news out there and it\u2019s my job to stay on top of it \u2014 and make sense of it \u2014 so you can stay in the know. \u2014\u00a0Mary Ann\nHello, and welcome back. We finally got our power restored after the ice storm and I\u2019m feeling better after coming down with a cold \u2014 but since I\u2019m still not operating at full capacity, this newsletter will be a bit abbreviated.\nRebrands are not uncommon in the startup world, and the fintech space is no exception. They are particularly more prevalent when companies pivot to adapt to external circumstances. Last week, TripActions announced it was rebranding and is now called Navan.\nI, for one, wasn\u2019t at all surprised by the news since TripActions pivoted from being a travel expense management company to a corporate card and expense management for enterprises more generally soon after the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020. In 2021, CEO and co-founder Ariel Cohen told me that its revenue didn\u2019t just drop \u2014 it bottomed out . . . to zero. That\u2019s when execs decided to focus its efforts on its then-new Liquid offering, which appears to have worked out pretty well for the company. In October, amid its continued growth, the company raised $154 million in equity at a post-money valuation of $9.2 billion, up from its prior valuation of $7.5 billion, as well as a $150 million structured financing deal from Coatue. Then in December, it secured $400 million in credit facilities from Goldman Sachs and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).\nIts rebrand is more than just a name change, apparently. The company said it has now unified its travel, corporate and expense offerings into \u201ca single super application.\u201d On top of that, Navan \u2014 a combination of\u00a0navigate and avant (or forward) \u2014 claims to be the first travel company to integrate OpenAI and ChatGPT APIs across its infrastructure and product set.\nThe company says it is currently using the generative AI technology to write, test, and fix code with the aim of increasing its operational efficiency and reducing overhead. So now, through Ava \u2014 Navan\u2019s virtual assistant \u2014 travel managers are able to personalize recommendations and increase traveler engagement, execs claim. They say also that admins can use the tool as a personal assistant to perform tasks such as performing personalized data analysis, providing granular carbon emission details or ordering corporate cards for their company. Meanwhile, travelers can do things like perform a travel search, solve customer support issues and even recommend an Indian restaurant near their hotel in London, for example.\nA company spokesperson told me via email: \u201cProgram admins will be able to ask Ava for reporting across the travel and spend programs, whether that is via text, graph, PDF, etc.\u00a0 We also use AI to do everything from the elimination of expense reporting to automate itemization \u2014 and in the case of hotel folios, we instantly fetch it from the hotel after a stay, categorize line items, compare that against company policy, and submit for the user, so there\u2019s no need for them [to] move pennies around in order to balance out a folio \u2014 a process that\u2019s pretty painful in my experience.\u201d\nPersonally, we\u2019ve been wondering at TC when generative AI was going to impact the fintech space, so I\u2019m intrigued by this move on TripAction\u2019s \u2014 I mean Navan\u2019s \u2014 part.\nBut I should point out Navan wasn\u2019t the only company in the financial services space that announced it was incorporating AI into its products.\nLast week, TechCrunch\u2019s Sarah Perez reported that Microsoft and American Express announced they were teaming up to put AI to work \u201cto aid with the frustrating and laborious task of filing and auditing corporate expense reports.\u201d She wrote: \u201cThe companies agreed to expand their decades-long partnership to build solutions that leverage Microsoft Cloud and AI technologies, starting with expense report management. According to Amex, the initial solution will leverage machine learning and AI to automate expense reporting and approvals.\u201d Notably, though, Amex says the AI is something it built in-house \u2014 it\u2019s not leveraging Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI but is using Microsoft Cloud. You can read more about that deal here.\nFascinating! I expect we\u2019ll only be hearing more about AI being incorporated in the world of financial services.\nLast week, Affirm announced that it was reducing its staff by 19% and shutting down its crypto unit. It also missed analysts\u2019 estimates on its revenue and earnings. All this news led to a sharp drop in its stock price. It\u2019s further evidence that buy now, pay later as a space is struggling. I plan to get into that more next week, so stay tuned.\nGusto also slashed jobs \u2014 laying off 126 people last week. Last May, TechCrunch had reported that the HR technology unicorn, which was worth nearly $10 billion at that time, raised an extension to its 2021-era Series E funding round. That funding event included $175 million in primary capital, a tranche of secondary shares and a tender offer.\nIronically, TC\u2019s Natasha Mascarenhas explains, late last month, Gusto\u2019s editor-in-chief wrote about the topic of layoffs \u2014 and the silver lining ahead for small businesses looking to scoop up talent.\n\u201cCall me cynical, but in the end, a big business will always choose itself over scores of its employees. It\u2019s just the nature of the beast. Small businesses need to use this fact to their advantage.\u201d\nTechCrunch reached out to Gusto for comment and was told that the cuts represented about 5% of the workforce. A spokesperson also told me: \u201cAll employees were notified by email. Impacted employees also received a text pointing them to the email.\u201d One employee, who wished to remain anonymous, said the move came as a surprise since the company claims that it is in \u201cstable financial condition.\u201d The same employee cited a toxic work culture, a sentiment that was echoed by some users of Blind.\nAccording to Axios: \u201cRobinhood announced it plans to buy back shares from Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s Emergent Fidelity Technologies. That particular Robinhood stake is currently in legal hell after FTX\u2019s implosion. Robinhood\u2019s board has authorized the purchase of \u201cmost or all\u201d of the 55 million shares Emergent Fidelity Technologies acquired last year, it said in its earnings report Wednesday. Emergent Fidelity Technologies was formed to buy a 7.6% in Robinhood in early 2022. Now however, the stake is being disputed by several players.\u201d Ouch. I\u2019m sure Robinhood didn\u2019t anticipate this when giving up those shares.\nPie Insurance, which provides workers\u2019 compensation insurance to small businesses, announced that it has completed its transition to a \u201crated, full-stack carrier.\u201d Pie will begin issuing its own insurance policies later this year following the recent acquisition of a nationally licensed insurance company (previously the American Insurance Company), now renamed the Pie Insurance Company. We last covered Pie in September when it raised a $315 million Series D. Pie also expanded into commercial auto insurance as the MGA for Ford Motor Credit Company through the launch of Ford Pro Insure.\nFrom Manish Singh: \u201cFintech Kissht and PayU\u2019s LazyPay are among the apps that India\u2019s IT Ministry has blocked in the ongoing crackdown as New Delhi moves to curb the misuse of consumers\u2019 data and protect the nation\u2019s integrity.\u201d More here.\nPayPal\u2019s stock is up\u00a0once again. The company announced during its fourth-quarter earnings announcement that longtime CEO Dan Schulman plans to retire at the end of the year. But its earnings topped analysts\u2019 estimates. Last week, we wrote about the company\u2019s plans to lay off 2,000 employees.\nIn July 2022, Brazilian fintech alt.bank launched nov\u00fccard, a credit card in Brazil that has a \u201cdynamic\u201d credit limit, with the ability to see the limit adjusted upward and downward automatically based on usage and payment timeliness. A company spokesperson told me that since that launch, nov\u00fccard has grown to 150,000 new clients, \u201cmaking it the fastest growing credit card in Brazil.\u201d She added: \u201cAs many as 3,000 new customers per day are obtaining a new nov\u00fccard. The company expects this figure will grow, boosted primarily by word of mouth \u2014 and that the number of customers will increase to 2 million by the end of 2023.\u201d Founded by American Brad Liebmann, fintech alt.bank has 130 employees based primarily in S\u00e3o Paulo and S\u00e3o Carlos. The company raised $5.5 million in seed funding in May of 2021.\nFormer Gemini CTO launches Fierce, a high-yield finance super app\nNew social investment platform Follow taps influencers to mirror their investment strategies\nSUMA Wealth acquires Reel to close the U.S. wealth gap.\u00a0Christine covered last year: https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/21\/suma-wealth-latinos-credit-gaming\/\nSequoia Capital Southeast Asia backs cross-border payments startup Tazapay\nInvestment platform Moonfare caps Series C extension at $15M\nThat\u2019s it for this week.

To get this in your inbox, subscribe here.\n\u201cSan Francisco is back!\u201d\n\u201cIt never left.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been long dead.\u201d\nThey\u2019re all takes, none particularly good, yet all insinuating a degree of self-importance that you, of all people, know when a city\u2019s heart is pulsing in a way that should count.\nTo me, San Francisco, despite all the transience and frustration it\u2019s been known to be associated with, feels like it never left. It\u2019s too simplistic to believe that cities can leave our lives, disappear from culture or bid away relevance. I\u2019m not saying that San Francisco didn\u2019t legit have a mass exodus with empty storefronts and office buildings \u2014 that is very much a thing that happened. But people are slowly trickling back: According to Vox, citing LinkedIn data, \u201cover the last 12 months, San Francisco has seen the second-biggest worker population gain of any area in the United States.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been felt. It feels nice to eavesdrop on conversations and hear people talking about the future, to see bookstores filled until close and to have a full schedule of networking events and happy hours. I\u2019m constantly reuniting with people I\u2019ve only known over Twitter DMs and bumping into people \u2014 an \u201cI\u2019ve lived here\u201d milestone I\u2019ve only dreamt of. Maybe it\u2019s just the way I\u2019ve been experiencing San Francisco, but it feels like the more social energy around us is less cocky, more present. Like, yes, there\u2019s a huge hype cycle around AI and I think people are flocking to Hayes Valley for some reason, but from the smattering of founders I\u2019ve had coffee with lately? They seem more focused on building than getting covered in TechCrunch pre-product. Maybe I\u2019m just lucky, but I feel like the SF that is back feels more grounded, less boastful.\nIt makes me think: Cities never leave our lives, they simply teach us lessons about cyclic moments, transient friendships and how community can be fickle.\nIf you enjoy this newsletter, you should check out my personal blog too!

TC\u2019s Dominic-Madori Davis has written a pair of stories looking at how the artificial intelligence boom is sitting with historically underfunded minorities. There\u2019s good news, and there\u2019s bad. Let\u2019s start with the good: First, women-founded AI startups are seeing a boost in VC funding. Heck yes. At the same time, the work is not done \u2014 bias continues to appear all through AI, from investments VCs make to the products that founders are building.\nHere\u2019s why this is important, in Davis\u2019 words: \u201cDiscussions about diversity are more important than ever as AI enters a new golden era. Every new technology that appears seems to be accompanied by some harrowing consequence. So far, AI has contributed to racist job recruiting tactics and slower home approval rates for Black people. Self-driving cars have trouble detecting dark skin, making Black people more likely to be hit by them; in one instance, robots identified Black men as being criminals 9% more than they did white men, which would be put under a new light if judicial systems ever [began] adopting AI.\u201d\n\nImage Credits: salihkilic \/ Getty Images\nSeen on TechCrunch\nCan you take back a gift?

Welcome back to the latest edition of Week in Review, the newsletter where we point you to some of the most-read TechCrunch stories from the past seven days. Want it in your inbox every Saturday morning (which, not for nothin\u2019, used to be cartoon time for this Gen Xer)? Here\u2019s the link.\nAnd now, let\u2019s get on with this week in AI \u2014 I mean, this week in tech news.\nMicrosoft and AI: This week at a press event, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that \u201cit\u2019s a new day for search.\u201d He was referring to the company\u2019s integration of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT-4 into Bing, its 13-year-old search engine. The hope, say the folks in Redmond, is that the integration will help Bing better compete with Google. Downloads of the app jumped 10x after the AI news broke since Microsoft promises priority access to the new Bing to those who have it installed. Wanna get more in-depth? Check out Frederic\u2019s hands-on with the search engine.\nGoogle and AI: Trying not to be outdone, Google this week announced Bard, its counterpart to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. It\u2019s in a testing phase now and it will use Google\u2019s Language Model for Dialogue Applications to power a conversational AI that will draw on information on the web. But Devin also says that the company is losing control.\nMUM\u2019s the word (sorry, that was too easy): Google also announced this week that its \u201cmultisearch\u201d feature, which allows users to search using images and text, is now available globally on mobile. And guess what powers multisearch? AI tech called Multitask Unified Model. MUM!\nGitHub layoffs: This week, Microsoft\u2019s GitHub announced it is laying off 10% of its staff of 3,000. As part of the effort to \u201cprotect the short-term health\u201d of the company, GitHub will also close all of its offices and go fully remote.\nApple execs on the M2: In a wide-ranging interview with Apple VPs, my boss and TechCrunch editor-in-chief Matthew Panzarino explored the company\u2019s latest in its M line of chips, and went deep on the M2 MacBook Pro and Mac mini models. Spoiler alert: They\u2019re faster.\nIndia blocks betting and loan apps: India\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has called to block 232 betting and loan apps in order to keep users\u2019 data safe, among other reasons.\nFootball!: It\u2019s Super Bowl LVII time and there are ways you\u2019ll be able to stream it. Get all the details here.\nOn Equity this week, Natasha spoke to Cleo\u2019s chief business officer and former CEO SJ Sacchetti about ego, setting boundaries, stepping down and becoming a \u201cstatistic\u201d and why a company needs to succeed without you. And on Found, Darrell and Becca talked to Keta Burke-Williams, the founder and CEO of direct-to-consumer fragrance company Ourside, about what got her interested in disrupting the behemoth \u2014 and outdated \u2014 fragrance industry.\nTC+ subscribers get access to in-depth commentary, analysis and surveys \u2014 which you know if you\u2019re already a subscriber.

Here are a few highlights from this week:\nThe bias of AI: Dom reports that bias appears in most aspects of AI, from investment and hiring to data collection and production. So the question remains: Who is the next frontier of AI really for?\nAfrica\u2019s startup ecosystem: Last year saw record investments in African startups. Tage talked to eight investors and discovered that key to this was pre-seed and seed-stage investors. But there is still a long way to go.\nSpinach.io\u2019s Pitch Deck Teardown: Haje turns his attention to the seed deck of Spinach.io, a company building out its meeting tool for engineers.\nFor cybersecurity pros: Contributor David J. Bianco writes about the defender\u2019s dilemma: \u201cThe idea that attackers have all the advantages and that defenders must be passive and wait for something to respond to is practically an axiom of cybersecurity. It is also a lie.\u201d","14":"\nW\nelcome to the TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It\u2019s inspired by the daily TechCrunch+ column where it gets its name. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here.\nJust because you\u2019re a startup doesn\u2019t mean you can be careless with the data you\u2019re handling, but enterprise-grade compliance and privacy used to be prohibitively expensive for small teams. This is starting to change. \u2014 Anna\nWhen it comes to selling products and services to enterprise clients, compliance is a requirement for any vendor \u2014 including startups.\nHowever, meeting governance, risk and compliance (GRC) standards and proving that you\u2019ve done so used to be very expensive. A new wave of startups that are helping others prepare for compliance audits has cropped up, but entrepreneur Sravish Sridhar thinks that more can be done.\n ","15":"\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t look safe.\u201d\nThe statement would follow me for days. Every time I mentioned I was test driving Arcimoto\u2019s Fun Utility Vehicle \u2014 an open air, all-electric three-wheeler \u2014 a friend or co-worker would pipe up to state, what to them, seemed like the obvious.\nAfter all, most cars have four wheels, not three. They also tend to have doors and airbags too.\u00a0\nArcimoto\u2019s FUV (or Fooove as I chose to pronounce it) has something most of those fully enclosed sedans and subcompacts do not: It\u2019s a thrill to drive without feeling like a deathtrap. \nLegally speaking, the FUV is a motorcycle. I think of it more as an electric go-kart that hits 75 mph on the highway. If you\u2019re like my colleague Brian Heater, however, your first thought might be \u201cFlintmobile.\u201d Another colleague wondered if it was more like an ATV. While yet another friend later said the FUV\u00a0reminded them of a Little Tikes Cozy Coupe. \nWhatever you conclude on first blush, one thing\u2019s for sure: If you want to drive something that everyone will hastily form an opinion of, then oh boy is this the car for you.\nA quick, 10-minute walkthrough and lap around the block was apparently all the training I needed before an Arcimoto staffer sent me off on my own in the FUV. \nI picked it up at GoCar Tours Las Vegas, and really that\u2019s the rub. The FUV could be a neat little neighborhood cruiser, but in a town like Vegas, this three-wheeler screams touristic excursion. Arcimoto may as well\u2019ve built it for soaking in the spectacle of the Strip, but I\u2019d like to think the little guy also introduced some flavor of its own to the otherwise SUV-dominated roads.\nDriving down the Strip in the Arcimoto FUV\nThe FUV features heated seats and handlebars to compensate for the wind chill. There\u2019s also a steel panoramic roof (that GoCar filled in with ads), a hand and foot break (the former is regenerative), Bluetooth speakers and a projected 102-mile range in the city.\nI adjusted to the handlebar throttle (and missing steering wheel) quicker than I expected. At a traffic signal, I queued a few songs I felt comfortable subjecting passerbys to, sank deeper into the front seat and rode around like I had real errands to do.\nI\u2019m a habitual, smug pedestrian and don\u2019t own a car, but as I pulled into a pharmacy parking lot and tugged my tote bag out of the trunk (a small, lockable \u201ccargo box\u201d), I thought: \u201cHey, three wheels are better than none.\u201d I was riding high on Pixies\u2019 Doolittle album and the novelty of it all, cruising down virtually empty roads shortly before CES attendees and cabs would clog Sin City\u2019s arteries.\u00a0\nThe FUV is tiny, but it can\u2019t exactly weave around traffic like a conventional motorcycle. Still, there were moments I deeply appreciated its small stature, and steered around stretches of cars that were taking up half the lane waiting to turn.\nAnother shot of Arcimoto\u2019s FUV on the Strip\nPlus, I could park just about anywhere. It takes up so little space that reserving an entire parking spot for the FUV seems almost wasteful.\u00a0\nRiding around with a passenger in the back was also a joy. You may not believe it, but the roof does a nice job of reflecting sound, so I could easily chat with my colleague Natalie Christman while she filmed from the rear seat.\nHaving someone along with you also means you\u2019re bound to spot more reactions from pedestrians. In our case, they ranged from blank stares and upward nods to outright yelling. It isn\u2019t easy to hear what someone\u2019s shouting from the sidewalk across ultra-wide streets, but I made out some variations of, \u201cwhat\u2019s that!?\u201d and \u201cIs that new?!\u201d (It isn\u2019t. The FUV debuted in 2019.)\nParking the FUV with plenty of room to spare\nMy stay in Vegas was exceedingly wet, as rare storms dumped buckets on the city. I considered this a challenge for both myself and the FUV. I agreed to endure a couple days of chilled knuckles and wet pants, so long as the goofy little vehicle did not slip \u2018n slide us beneath a hulking pickup. It didn\u2019t!\nThe rain wasn\u2019t too challenging. Sometimes my hands went a bit numb despite the heated grips. (If I owned a FUV, I would just keep a pair of gloves in the back.) Occasionally, I dodged puddles. It was a small hassle to brush rainwater off the seat and the roof mostly did its job.\nIn a sprinkle, I sipped an iced latte and jotted down notes on how cold I felt. Why am I this way?\nOther FUV downsides included the extra-heavy steering. It really made me work to get around turns from a full stop, handling almost like a car without power steering. I was told when I picked it up that the latest iteration of the FUV addresses this and steers lighter.\nAfter a while, the attention got old, too. I\u2019m an introverted trans lady, so I\u2019m not here for the stares that accompany a visually loud vehicle. I don\u2019t see this as a deal breaker, though \u2014 just an observation. I also love very goofy cars, so this is more of a personal contradiction than anything else.\nThe FUV is certainly goofy. However, in normally dry locales like Las Vegas or say, Los Angeles, it struck me as, dare I say, practical. I would prefer a teeny city car with doors and windows, and there are three-wheelers on the market that offer just that, including Electra Meccanica\u2019s SOLO.\nWith room for a passenger (unlike the SOLO) and an overall breezy driving experience on a single charge, I still think Arcimoto\u2019s FUV is less silly than it initially lets on.\nThe name makes it seem like a car best left for tourists; I\u2019d happily ride it around my neighborhood for light errands. It seemed sturdy and dependable in the three and a half days I spent with it, and riding on three wheels seemed just as natural to me as four. (Side note: I did take it on the highway, reaching around 60 mph, and that was a bit too thrilling for my taste.)\nThere are plenty of reasons to opt for an extra small vehicle, especially if you live in a dense area. For one, smaller vehicles require fewer materials and smaller batteries, which at least in theory should translate to lower emissions. Smaller vehicles are also less likely to kill pedestrians.\nIf you have any safety concerns, you can check out what Arcimoto has to say about that here. A spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch that the FUV\u2019s \u201csteel upper frame meets the FMVSS 216a Roof Crush Resistance standard.\u201d\nThe car also includes a crash-sensor that disconnects the battery on impact and \u201cdual 3-point safety seatbelts.\u201d That means you have to buckle up twice when you get in.\nIf you want to try the FUV out for yourself, you may want to hurry. After laying off dozens of staffers, Eugene, Oregon-based Arcimoto alerted investors in January that it was running out of cash.\n\u201cWe have halted our production of vehicles and will require substantial additional funding to resume production,\u201d the automaker said.\nWithout fresh funds, Arcimoto warned at the time that it \u201cwill be required to cease our operations and\/or seek bankruptcy protection.\u201d The startup\u2019s market cap sat around $13.5 million when this story was published, a far cry from its $1 billion-plus high two years ago.\nThe FUV starts at $17,900 before subsidies, but the price creeps above $25,000 with upgrades like fancier seats, half doors, a rear cargo box and cup holders. Arcimoto also sells used FUVs; on its site, the company has one listed for $16,800.\nIf you know something about Arcimoto, reach out to this reporter via email or Twitter DM.","16":"\nWelcome back to Chain Reaction, a podcast diving deep into stories, backgrounds and latest news with the biggest names in crypto.\nFor this week\u2019s episode, I interviewed Gwendolyn Regina, investment director at layer-1 blockchain BNB Chain. Prior to her current role, Regina worked at Facebook \u2014 or, as some call it now, Meta \u2014 building a new business unit for venture capital partnerships and startup growth. She\u2019s also a founder of a few different businesses and a founding team member for an early-stage tech investment firm, Thymos Capital.\nAs investment director, Regina looks at new projects, talks to developers and runs BNB Chain\u2019s grant program, which picks up to 10 projects a month to help them grow on the chain.\nBNB Chain was launched in September 2020 and was initially kicked off by Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange by trading volume.\nSince then, BNB Chain has aimed to be a decentralized, community-owned separate entity from Binance with a focus on three audiences: retail markets, builders and developers, and bridging Web2.0 businesses to web3, Regina said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to, number one, grow the blockchain and grow the pie.\u201d\nAlthough the past year has been shaky for crypto markets, BNB\u2019s investment strategy takes a long-term view and is mainly not affected by day-to-day market events, Regina explained.\n\u201cOur investment thesis doesn\u2019t change and yet it also changes,\u201d Regina joked. \u201cWe all know blockchain and crypto move incredibly fast, so we are more precise in certain areas but largely speaking it has not changed.\u201d\nAll in all, through the bear market and \u201cmini bulls\u201d along the way, \u201cwe\u2019re in a phase where everyone is building,\u201d Regina said. \u201cAnd we want to enable more capabilities on BNB Chain.\u201d\nWeb3 gaming on BNB Chain also has grown \u201corganically through robustness and cheaper fees,\u201d but the blockchain\u2019s team is now \u201cdoubling down\u201d in that sector to encourage more gamers and developers to play and build on its chain, Regina added. Out of its 1 million daily active users, about 40% are gamers, she shared.\n\u201cOur GameFi infrastructure has always been relatively strong but because things evolve so much we\u2019re really trying to find one-stop shop GameFi infrastructure,\u201d Regina said. \u201cGoing back to our investment thesis, when we look at the different themes, we always ask ourselves what is missing now and more importantly [\u2026] you have to think about what will be important in six months.\u201d\nFor Regina and the BNB investment team, investments are \u201cmore than financial capital; it\u2019s really a lot of growth incentives,\u201d among other elements.\nChain Reaction comes out every other Thursday at 12:00 p.m. PT, so be sure to subscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your favorite pod platform to keep up with the action.","17":"\nEmerging Indian social media app Slick left an internal database containing users\u2019 personal information, including data of school-going children, publicly exposed to the internet for months.\nSince at least December 11, a database containing full names, mobile numbers, dates of birth, and profile pictures of Slick users was left online without a password.\nBengaluru-based Slick launched in November 2022 by former Unacademy executive Archit Nanda after pivoting from crypto and closing his earlier startup CoinMint. His latest venture, Slick, is available on both Android and iOS and works similarly to Gas, a compliments-based app that is popular in the United States. The app also allows school and college students to talk with and about their friends anonymously.\nSecurity researcher Anurag Sen from CloudDefense.ai found the exposed database, and asked TechCrunch for help in reporting the incident to the social media startup. Slick secured the database a short time after TechCrunch reached out on Friday.\nDue to a misconfiguration, anyone familiar with the database\u2019s IP address could access the database, which contained entries of over 153,000 users at the time it was secured. TechCrunch also found that the database could be accessed by an easy-to-guess subdomain on Slick\u2019s main website.\nThe researcher also informed the India\u2019s computer emergency response team, known as CERT-In, the country\u2019s lead agency for handling cybersecurity issues.\nNanda confirmed to TechCrunch that Slick fixed the exposure. It\u2019s not known if anyone other than Sen found the database before it was secured.\nSlick attracted many younger users in India shortly after debuting last year. Earlier this month, Nanda took to Twitter to announce that the app crossed 100,000 downloads.","18":"\nTwitter is still in the early days of its Elon Musk era, but the company\u2019s new owner hasn\u2019t hesitated in leaving his mark on the social network.\nAccording to a new survey from GLAAD, Amnesty International, and the Human Rights Campaign, prominent LGBTQ accounts are already noticing a difference on the platform under Musk\u2019s leadership.\nOut of 11 LGBGT organizations surveyed, five reported experiencing more frequent abuse and hate speech following Musk\u2019s takeover in late October. None of the groups saw a decrease in targeted hate during the same time period.\nWhen asked if their organization had encountered a similar uptick in hate on other social networks, 90% of the respondents said that the increase in harassment was limited to Twitter. All of the organizations reported encountering hate speech and harassment on Twitter, whether in the pre or post-Musk eras.\nThe survey, which focused on accounts with more than 10,000 followers, is far from comprehensive, but it was designed to capture a \u201csnapshot\u201d of the social media landscape in the early months following Musk\u2019s $44 billion takeover. After buying Twitter, Musk quickly reversed many of the company\u2019s content moderation decisions, including some high profile cases that set an ominous precedent for the platform\u2019s many LGBTQ users.\nIn November, Twitter reinstated right wing academic Jordan Peterson and The Babylon Bee, two accounts originally suspended for transphobic tweets about transgender actor Elliot Page and U.S. health official Rachel Levine, respectively. Musk had previously characterized Peterson\u2019s infraction as \u201cminor & dubious,\u201d signaling his interest in reversing LGBTQ-related suspensions.\nA report from GLAAD and Media Matters published in December tracked a handful of popular right-wing Twitter accounts and found a post-Musk spike in the use of the word \u201cgroomer\u201d \u2014 an increasingly prevalent slur that labels queer people as pedophiles. Prior to Musk\u2019s loosening of the platform\u2019s rules around hate, Twitter classified the term as a banned anti-LGBTQ slur.\nIn December, Musk himself made the unfounded suggestion that Yoel Roth, Twitter\u2019s well-respected former head of Trust and Safety, was a pedophile, kicking off a firestorm of anti-LGBTQ harassment that ultimately drove the gay former Twitter executive out of his Bay Area home.\n\u201c\u2026 This lie led directly to a wave of homophobic and antisemitic threats, of which Twitter has removed vanishingly little\u2026 [and] ultimately I had to leave my home and sell it,\u201d Roth told Congress earlier this week.\n\u201cThose are the consequences of this kind of online harassment and speech.\u201d\nElon Musk just brought an infamous neo-Nazi back to Twitter\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Twitter already looks grim for the LGBTQ community\n","19":"\nTo get a roundup of TechCrunch\u2019s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, subscribe here.\nIt\u2019s Friday, and we\u2019re slumping back in our office chairs with a hot cup of coffee after a week that\u2019s been as slow as mid-winter molasses.\nFor Black History Month, we are in awe of the story of Sojourner Truth, who was an American abolitionist and women\u2019s rights activist.

Otonomo went public in a 2021 SPAC, at the time valued at $1.4 billion, but that has since dipped to $70 million. Ingrid writes, \u201cIt\u2019s been a bumpy road for smart mobility technology \u2014 with macroeconomic pressures, the slower development and rollouts of next-generation technology like autonomous systems and the cooling tech investing market all making it harder for younger businesses to sustain and grow their businesses.

Two people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times that there has been a lack of clarity around budgets and the future headcount at the company. The job cuts are expected to take place around March, but it\u2019s unknown how people could be affected.\nThe lack of clarity has resulted in staff noting that not much work is getting done, as managers have been unable to plan ahead, the report says. Certain budgets that would normally be finalized by the end of the year still haven\u2019t been finalized, and decisions that would usually take days to be signed off on are now taking a month in some cases.\nMeta did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nThe report comes as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said earlier this month during an earnings call with analysts that the company plans to continue to contain costs. He promised a \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d and said that Meta would be more proactive about cutting low-priority and low-performance roles. Zuckerberg noted that Meta would be flattening its organization structure and \u201cremoving some layers in middle management to make decisions faster.\u201d\nIn November, Meta laid off 11,000 employees, or about 13% of its global workforce. The cuts were the largest in Meta\u2019s history and impacted multiple departments within the company, with recruiting and business teams affected the most. At the time, the company said its\u00a0hiring freeze would extend into early 2023, with only a \u201csmall number of exceptions.\u201d\nAlthough Meta clearly isn\u2019t the only company to announce layoffs in the past year, it\u2019s one of the few to expand on its previous layoffs. For instance, Amazon originally said that it would lay off 10,000 employees, but later expanded that figure to 18,000. In addition, Coinbase recently laid off 950 employees, after already letting go of 1,100 employees last June.\nThe news comes as Meta announced today that its chief business officer, Marne Levine, is stepping down after 13 years at the company. During her time at Meta, Levine serviced as the first chief operating officer at Instagram, and was also the vice president of global public policy at Facebook.

Swedish BNPL giant Klarna has also taken a massive hit to its valuation, coming in at $6.7 billion in July, down 85% from June 2021.\nMorgan Stanley downgraded Affirm\u2019s stock last week as well, saying the company\u2019s offerings \u201care too large given narrow incremental benefits\u201d\nIn September, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a report suggesting that companies like Klarna, Affirm and Afterpay, which all allow customers to pay for products and services in installments, must be subjected to stricter oversight. The report may have been too little, too late; many are concerned that BNPL does not constitute responsible lending, and it\u2019s hard to tell whether the model itself is sustainable in the long term.\nIn a July 2022 report, Fitch Ratings noted that some of the largest BNPL providers had seen delinquency rates more than double over the previous few quarters, while credit card delinquency rates were relatively flat, \u201cunderscoring the BNPL\u2019s lower asset quality,\u201d according to the report.\n ","23":"\nWhat\u2019s it take to bring a tech conference to life?

Ford said it is working with Chinese company Contemporary Amperex Technology Co, known as CATL, confirming previous coverage.\u00a0Under the arrangement, Ford\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary would manufacture the battery cells using LFP battery cell knowledge and services provided by CATL.\n\u201cWe are committed to leading the electric vehicle revolution in America, and that means investing in the technology and jobs that will keep us on the cutting edge of this global transformation in our industry,\u201d said\u00a0 Ford executive chair Bill Ford said in a statement. \u201cI am also proud that we chose our home state of Michigan for this critical battery production hub.\u201d\nThe $3.5 billion factory is part of Ford\u2019s plan to invest more than $50 billion in electric vehicles globally through 2026. Ford said it plans o deliver an annual run rate of 600,000 electric vehicles globally by the end of this year and 2 million globally by the end of 2026.\nThe factory, called BlueOval Battery Park Michigan, will initially employ 2,500 workers, according to the company. Production is expected to begin in 2026. Ford will have the option to further grow its battery capacity plant.\nFord said it is adding the LFP batteries to its lineup this spring, starting with the Mustang Mach-E, CEO Jim Farley said during a press conference Monday. Ford said last summer that CATL would supply LFP battery packs for the Mach-E SUVs in North America starting in 2023 followed by F-150 Lightning pickup trucks in early 2024.\nFord\u2019s decision to manufacture LFP batteries in the United States is part of a trend among automakers to adopt this an older, cheaper and safer technology. Tesla, for instance, already uses LFP batteries in the EVs it makes and sells in China.\nChina has owned the LFP market for nearly a decade due to an agreement with a consortium of universities in the U.S. and Canada that hold patents on the technology. But that is poised to change as access to patents open up and the cost of battery materials rise.\nNewer battery chemistries like nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) and nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) have the benefit of higher energy density that improves the range of their batteries. However,\u00a0LFP doesn\u2019t use scarce raw materials like cobalt and nickel, making them cheaper, and are less likely to catch fire. Those perks have become more appealing to automakers as seek to offer more affordable EVs, while maintaining or even improving profit margins.\nCorrection: Ford\u2019s new $3.5 billion factory in Michigan will only manufacture LFP batteries, not nickel cobalt manganese (NCM) and LFP batteries.","25":"\nMeena Harris knows how to build. The lawyer and author grew her side hustle of making activist T-shirts into a behemoth of a brand, Phenomenal, which recently expanded from merchandising to media to entertainment. Now, she wants to invest in those who show that same scrappiness with her next, and literal, venture: Phenomenal Ventures.\nThe entrepreneur, who is the niece of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, is starting the venture firm with partner Helen Min, a former head of marketing at AngelList, Plaid and beyond. The duo met as early employees at Facebook, where they became close friends and eventually tech operators who shared notes on everything from grad school to angel investing. The idea for a joint VC firm materialized in 2021, months before the downturn began, Harris explained.\n\u201cWe feel really confident in our ability to succeed, but also wanted to start modestly and just do the work, despite some of the uncertainty around the economy,\u201d she said.\nPhenomenal Ventures has already closed a debut early-stage-focused fund totaling $6 million, with investments from firms including 776, Tribe Capital, Slow Ventures and founders from tech companies including Dropbox, Quora and Pinterest. Around 38% of LPs are founders or former founders. Nearly half of the fund\u2019s investors self-identify as women, and 12% as Black.\nThe new fund allows Phenomenal Ventures to participate in pre-seed to Series A rounds, averaging check sizes around $100,00 to $500,000. The firm additionally tapped Zabreen Khan as a partner, who started her investment track at Andreessen Horowitz and Lead Edge Capital.\nThe firm has invested in 13 companies so far, nine of which are built by underrepresented founders (although Min said they don\u2019t have any specific diversity mandate or quota).\n\u201cEvery company that Meena and I have worked for \u2014 as startups employees at Facebook, Slack, Dropbox, Uber, Plaid, Quora, AngelList, they are literally all by non-underrepresented founders \u2014 our networks very much reflect those companies and the networks we were a part of for so long, to say we\u2019re going to turn [down] that deal flow that surfaces because of the network we\u2019re a part of\u2026 I don\u2019t think [that] super makes sense, especially not for fund one,\u201d Min said. \u201cVenture is all about leveraging the unique access that you have.\u201d\nThe timing of the firm\u2019s public launch is notable. The tech industry is going through a reset, as shown in public market struggles and sector-agnostic layoffs. Funding for female founders is dropping. \u201cThere are funds of all sizes still being raised, we know that there\u2019s money out there that is still being deployed and raised, but not many of them are led by solo GPs \u2014 even fewer are led by women, let alone women of color, or people like us who are women of color and aren\u2019t career venture capitalists,\u201d Harris said.\nThe fundraising process for Phenomenal Ventures\u2019 fund, per Min, took around a year. \u201cI am very transparent about this and I wish more people were: we set out to raise a larger fund,\u201d she said, adding that they closed the first half of the fund in the first three weeks of fundraising. Then, Min says, the slowdown froze LPs, impacting the fundraising process.\nEventually, Harris and Min decided that they would stop fundraising after their first close, focusing on making this a proof of concept fund that puts them in business. \u201cThere\u2019s a real tradeoff between the time that we spend fundraising and the time that we can actually spend with deal flow and meeting founders and helping our portfolio companies, so we decided to call it,\u201d Min added.\n\u201cWe really feel confident in our ability to succeed but also really wanted to start modestly and just do the work\u2026despite some of the uncertainty around the economy,\u201d Harris said, later adding, \u201cyou can be fundraising forever, especially in terms of what the economy looks like.\u201d\nHarris said that Phenomenal Media and Phenomenal Ventures will operate as two separate legal entities. Optically, the brand overlap certainly helps with marketing; yet Phenomenal brand\u2019s roots of being in the e-commerce space means that the firm often gets inbound pitches for physical goods. While Min says they never categorically say no to the DTC category \u2014 which has been through tumultuous times over the past few years \u2014 they tend to invest in what they know: which are software enterprise companies, fintech and future of commerce.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a big surprise to people because we are women, and then the Phenomenal brand and just sort of its history,\u201d Min said. \u201cBut we\u2019re really focused on things that will have venture-like returns.\u201d\nFor Harris, the firm feels like the opportunity to have a \u201cmission-driven impact\u201d on the tech industry that she has been a part of for over 15 years. She\u2019s eyeing the entire \u201cvalue chain\u201d of startups, with the first stop being venture.\n\u201cWith venture, and doing it at this scale, you have the ability to make an impact with your LPs, GPs, founders or portfolio companies down to employee culture and the end users that they serve,\u201d Harris said.","26":"\nIs the AI photo app trend already over? Over the past several months, AI-powered photo apps had been going viral on the App Store as consumers explored AI powered-experiences like Lensa AI\u2019s \u201cmagic avatars\u201d feature and other apps promising to turn text into images using AI tech. But new data from app intelligence firm Apptopia indicates consumer interest in AI photo apps has fallen as quickly as it rose.\nThe firm analyzed top AI photo apps worldwide, tracking both their download growth and in-app consumer spending.\nIn its analysis shared with TechCrunch, Apptopia examined the leading AI photo app Lensa AI and others, including Voi, Remini, Pixelup, Fotor, Wonder, FacePlay, Aiby, FaceApp, Gradient, Dawn AI, Facetune, Prequel, Voila AI Artist, New Profile Pic Avatar Maker, and Meitu. (Voi was a later arrival, launching on Dec. 7.)\nApptopia found that this group of AI apps first began to take off around Thanksgiving, then hit their peak in terms of both downloads and in-app purchases around mid-December. At their height of popularity, the apps topped 4.3 million daily downloads and ~$1.8 million per day in consumer spending via in-app purchases.\nThose numbers have significantly dropped since. On November 11, the apps saw their lowest revenue, at $0.37 million. And, a week later on November 19, they saw the lowest number of downloads, at 0.84 million.\nAs of yesterday (not shown on the chart below), the same group of apps saw only around 952K combined downloads and around $507K in consumer spending, as the numbers continue to fall.\nAnother fad comes and goes. From my newsletter this morning. pic.twitter.com\/qRFCuCucxc\n\u2014 Adam Blacker (@AdamBlacker25) January 27, 2023\n\n\u00a0\nThis latest hype cycle began with Lensa AI\u2019s breakout success. Though the app has been around since 2018, Lensa AI went viral in late November to early December 2022 thanks to its new avatar feature which saw it jump to the No. 1 spot on the iOS App Store\u2019s competitive \u201cPhoto & Video\u201d charts ahead of bigger apps like YouTube and Instagram. Users were fascinated with the app\u2019s clever new \u201cmagic avatars\u201d feature which leveraged the open-source Stable Diffusion model to process selfie photos to generate avatars that looked like they had been made by a digital artist.\nBut there were soon a number of complaints about how this technology had been put to use. People found that it was too easy to trick the app into making NSFW images, and artists were upset that their work had been opted into the training data without their consent. The latter resulted in many of the AI profile pics having similarities to artists\u2019 own work \u2014 but they weren\u2019t the ones profiting from it.\nConsumers seemed to respond to the ethical concerns being raised. As TechCrunch had reported at the time, some people began to leave comments on AI photos and profile pictures posted on social media to tell people not to use an app that steals from artists. This backlash likely quelled some of the demand for the AI art. After all, it\u2019s not much fun to use an AI pic for your profile if you\u2019re essentially being accused of theft when doing so.\nPlus, some people only wanted to see the results of their own AI profile photos after seeing TikTok videos about the feature. After running through the creation process one time and receiving a collection of photos, there was not necessarily further interest in using the feature again.\nSome users also had complaints about the subscription required for what they thought should be a one-off task.\nIn addition, the app stores themselves had become overrun with AI photo apps, pushing numerous other AI apps into the App Store\u2019s Top Charts, some of which worked better than others. At one point in mid-December, the top three spots on the U.S. App Store were held by AI photo apps and many others were newly ranking in the Top 100. Sensor Tower estimates at the time indicated that 8 out of the top 100 apps by downloads were AI art apps. But the apps weren\u2019t particularly differentiated from one another, as they were all some variation on AI avatars \u2014 like those Lensa AI helped popularize \u2014 or offered another sort of AI image generator, like those that generated images from text prompts.\nThe market was immediately overly saturated. At the same time, there was growing interest in another form of AI technology: ChatGPT. The AI chatbot was released on November 30, 2022, and soon gained consumer attention. By January, the App Store was again flooded with AI apps. But this time around it was with dubious ChatGPT apps, not Lensa AI copycats. Apple quickly removed one of the more prominent fake ChatGPT apps, but others remained.\nMore recently, we\u2019ve seen consumer interest in ChatGPT-like experiences drive Microsoft\u2019s Bing to near the top of the App Store after it announced integrations with OpenAI\u2019s newer chatbot technology, which promises to be an improvement over ChatGPT. It\u2019s not clear if AI chatbots will actually unseat traditional search in the near or long term, despite the immediate threat, because there continue to be concerns around bots\u2019 ability to produce misinformation. But for now, these apps are the latest to intrigue consumers.\nThe burst of consumer interest in photo AI apps, ChatGPT, and now, Bing, indicates people are paying attention to AI technology and do want to test out the new ideas first-hand. A winner or winners may eventually emerge here, but it\u2019s too soon to tell.","27":"\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy Watch5 will now offer improved period tracking features thanks to a new partnership with Natural Cycles that leverages the smartwatch\u2019s temperature sensors to make better predictions. The launch follows last fall\u2019s announcement of a\u00a0new temperature sensor on the Apple Watch Series 8 that similarly allows wearers to improve their period predictions as well as view retrospective ovulation estimates when the watch is worn overnight.\nAccording to Samsung, the advanced period-tracking features will become available to smartwatch owners across 32 countries globally, including North America, Europe, and Asia.\nIt explains that Natural Cycles has developed an algorithm that uses body temperature and other fertility indicators to make predictions about fertility. This will be used along with the Watch5\u2019s new infrared sensor to track skin temperature changes overnight. The data is encrypted and stored on the device, Samsung says, where it\u2019s used to power its Health app\u2019s Cycle Tracking feature.\nSamsung had been late to market to launch its own period tracking feature, only adding the option to its Health app in 2020, long after Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, and other third-party apps had done so. But the manual period tracking method is reliant on historical data to make predictions \u2014 and that can only go so far. Adding the ability to track temperature changes can improve its accuracy.\n\u201cThe Natural Cycles app has helped millions of women around the world take control of their fertility and this partnership will allow Samsung to leverage our fertility technology to offer temperature-based cycle tracking through a smartwatch for the first time,\u201d said Dr. Raoul Scherwitzl, co-founder and co-CEO of Natural Cycles, in a statement.\nHowever, it\u2019s worth pointing out that Apple cautions its own customers that the temperature-tracking features it introduced should not be used as birth control or to diagnose health conditions \u2014 even though it may track temperature changes that could be your first alert to other health problems, like polycystic ovary syndrome or fibroids.\nPlus, Apple points out, overnight temperature tracking can be impacted by other factors, like the sleep environment, and it notes that body temperature naturally fluctuates when you sleep. Instead, Apple says temperature tracking is used to provide improved period predictions and retrospective ovulation estimates only.\nSamsung doesn\u2019t share those cautions in its own announcement, though, touting Natural Cycles\u2019 ability to determine \u201ceach user\u2019s unique fertility status.\u201d Likely, a doctor would suggest this method on its own should not be used to determine fertility, we\u2019d argue. But it could be useful in combination with other methods, including consistent AM basal temperature readings using a thermometer, other ovulation tests, and manually entered period tracker data.\nToday\u2019s news shows Samsung is attempting to keep up with a market where Apple has been leading. But since it\u2019s rushing to compete on this front, it chose to bring in a partner instead of creating an algorithm of its own in-house.\nIt\u2019s not the first time Samsung used a partnership to boost its Health app capabilities, either. The company previously announced a deal with Calm to upgrade the app\u2019s Mindfulness section with content, for instance.\nSamsung says the new skin temperature-based cycle tracking capabilities will come to the Samsung Health app on the Galaxy Watch5 and Watch5 Pro within the second quarter. 32 markets will support this feature, including Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S.","28":"\nMore than two years ago, Amazon subsidiary Zoox unveiled an electric, autonomous robotaxi it built from the ground up. Now, the cube-like vehicle that is loaded with sensors \u2014 and not a steering wheel \u2014 is starting to roll out on a few public roads in northern California.\nA solitary Zoox robotaxi made its inaugural launch on public roads over the weekend after the company received a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates autonomous vehicles in the state. Zoox said the vehicle has also passed a self-certification from the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.\nThe scope of Zoox\u2019s launch on public roads is limited; however, it does mark another milestone for a company that launched quietly eight years ago with an ambitious goal to build and operate a commercial robotaxi service with its own purpose-built vehicle. The company has been testing its custom robotaxi vehicles on \u201csemi-private courses\u201d in California since last year. This weekend was the first time the vehicle carried passengers on public roads.\nInitially, robotaxis will only be available to Zoox employees and run as a shuttle service on about a 2-mile loop between the company\u2019s two main buildings in Foster City, California.\u00a0\n\u201cThat sounds simple, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a very complex route,\u201d CEO Aicha Evans said in a news briefing with media. She noted that the route will include right-hand and left-hand turns, several traffic lights, pedestrians, bicyclists, as well as navigating in a parking lot and making a bi-directional turns, which the robotaxi is designed to carry out.\nThe employee shuttle service is launching in the spring. Zoox did not disclose the size of the shuttle fleet. Zoox co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson said the company has built dozens (not hundreds) of robotaxis and plans to add more of the vehicles to its permit with the DMW in the coming days.\nIt has been assumed that Zoox robotaxis would need an exemption from the federal government under FMVSS because the vehicles don\u2019t include traditional driving controls such as a steering wheel or pedals. Nuro, another AV company focused on delivery, received an exemption in early 2020 for its low-speed R2 vehicle.\nBut Zoox has insisted for months that an exemption isn\u2019t needed because it has incorporated FMVSS performance requirements into the vehicle.\nThe company didn\u2019t disclose when its employee service might expand to incorporate more roads or members of the public.\n\u201cYou can assume that at some point after the spring we\u2019ll be able to put other folks in the vehicle, but we don\u2019t have a specific date,\u201d Levinson said. We will need additional permits to put non Zoox employees in our vehicles on public roads.\u201d\nZoox currently tests Toyota Highlander vehicles equipped with its self-driving system on public roads San Francisco, Las Vegas and Foster City, California, near its headquarters, and Seattle.","29":"\nThere was a slew of movie trailers and TV show teasers that football fans\u2013and Rihanna fans\u2013got to watch during the 2023 Super Bowl last night.

The new Peacock crime series, \u201cPoker Face,\u201d is currently airing episodes every Thursday.\nAlso, Disney celebrated its 100th anniversary during the Super Bowl, giving viewers a look at the upcoming live-action movie, \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d starring Halle Bailey, as well as recent hits \u201cEncanto,\u201d \u201cZootopia\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and classics like \u201cMulan,\u201d \u201cLion King,\u201d \u201cPeter Pan\u201d and \u201cMary Poppins.\u201d\nLastly, Paramount+ debuted the trailer for its new docuseries \u201cThe Family Stallone,\u201d which stars actor Sylvester Stallone with his wife, Jennifer Flavin Stallone, and daughters Sophia, Sistine and Scarlet. The Big Game commercial also featured other familiar characters, such as Dora The Explorer, Beavis and Butt-Head, Captain Pike from \u201cStar Trek\u201d and more.\nHere are the tech industry\u2019s 2023 Super Bowl commercials, with noticeably less crypto\n\nHere\u2019s how to stream Super Bowl LVII 2023\n","30":"\nIn late 2013, Errplane, a Y Combinator-backed startup, began developing an open source project called InfluxDB for database performance monitoring and alerting. After raising several million in financing from VC firms including Mayfield Fund and Trinity Ventures, Errplane changed its name to InfluxData \u2014 and went on to raise tens of millions more in capital.\nYears later, it seems InfluxData is still doing something right. The company late last week announced that it raised $30 million in debt and $51 million in a Series E equity round led by Princeville Capital and Citi Ventures with participation from Battery Ventures, Mayfield and Sapphire Ventures, sources say at a valuation higher than its Series D in 2019. CEO Evan Kaplan tells TechCrunch that the combined $81 million will be put toward developing InfluxData\u2019s new database engine, InfluxDB IOx, as well as dedicated cloud tiers and a new on-premesis, enterprise-focused InfluxDB product built atop InfluxDB IOx.\nWhen asked why InfluxData decided to secure a loan alongside the new equity, Kaplan said that it\u2019s \u201cbeen customary\u201d for the company \u201cdepending on market conditions and growth requirements.\u201d Easier access to debt in the tech industry likely played a role, too. By year-end 2022, debt deal value for tech surpassed 2021 numbers with more than $29 billion raised across 2,188 deals, according to PitchBook\u2019s Venture-Monitor report.\n\u201cAnalyzing data in real time is an enormous challenge due to the sheer volume of data that today\u2019s applications, systems and devices create,\u201d Kaplan said via email. \u201cInfluxDB gives developers the ability to separate relevant signals from the \u2018noise\u2019 created by this huge amount of data.\u201d\nPlatforms like InfluxData have come into vogue in the last few years as the demand for real-time data analysis tools grows. SingleStore, which provides a platform to help enterprises integrate, monitor and query their data as a single entity, has raised more than $100 million in capital to date. Imply, another real-time database vendor, closed a $100 million Series D round in May that values the company at a $1.1 billion post-money.\nKaplan argues that databases purpose-built for analyzing real-time data \u2014 otherwise known as time series data, or data recorded over consistent intervals of time \u2014 offer advantages over the relational databases companies typically employ for their data workloads. For example, while relational databases have a defined schema, meaning changes like adding or removing columns require database migrations, time series databases tend to be \u201cschema-less\u201d and allow new fields to be added quickly and easily.\n\u201cWithin the time series universe itself, a top challenge is managing high-cardinality data volumes \u2014 pulling in the right data, transforming it and storing it in a way that makes it easy to derive value from it,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cThis is why a purpose-built solution for time series is critical; it lowers the barrier to entry and streamlines the impact times series data can have.\u201d\nAccording to Kaplan, InfluxData\u2019s customers primarily tap the company\u2019s platform to gain access to infrastructure, systems, apps and customer data in real time as well as centralize metrics, events, logs and tracing data across the organization. Those with physical assets also collect sensor and device data using InfluxData, whether originating from factories, manufacturing plants, smart devices or satellites.\n\u201cInfluxDB accelerates the pace at which organizations derive value from data,\u201d Kaplan averred. \u201cIT teams using InfluxDB can query data immediately after it is written, often measured in milliseconds, as opposed to many other data warehouses that rely on batch ingestion and delayed processing before delivering insights. By offering true real-time insights, InfluxDB ensures companies can collect and act on massive data volumes faster than ever.\u201d\nBesides the funding, the big news coming out of InfluxData is the launch of the aforementioned InfluxDB IOx, which was announced last November. Kaplan explains that InfluxDB IOx \u201creimagines\u201d InfluxDB as a columnar, real-time data service, giving users a time series engine designed to ingest and analyze high-volume, high-velocity data.\nInfluxDB IOx expands the number and variety of use cases that InfluxDB can handle, such as observability and distributed tracing, Kaplan says, while offering support for \u201cthe full range\u201d of time series data. Additionally, the rebuilt engine adds SQL language support for queries, bringing the ubiquitous data programming language to InfluxDB for the first time.\n\u201cThe release of InfluxDB IOx significantly improved on the platform\u2019s main benefits with the introduction of SQL support, the removal of cardinality limits and real-time queries that are up to 100x faster,\u201d Kaplan continued. \u201cCustomer interest in the new database engine is strong and we are bullish on the product roadmap to bring InfluxDB IOx to a wider population of developers. Furthermore, as InfluxDB IOx delivers full support for the golden triangle of observability data \u2014 metrics, logs and traces all in a single database \u2014 we can compete more aggressively in internet of things, cloud observability and other resource-intensive analytics settings.\nTechCrunch can\u2019t independently verify those performance claims. But on the customer side, InfluxData is objectively healthy (assuming the numbers Kaplan gave me are accurate, of course), with more than 1,900 commercial clients including Hulu, Siemens, Tesla, Cisco and IBM.\nKaplan acknowledged that InfluxData faces increasing competition from AWS (see: Timestream) and Microsoft Azure (Azure Data Explorer) and emerging open source vendors (Timescale, QuestDB). But he believes the rollout of InfluxDB IOx and the new financing round put the company in a position of strength.\n\u201cInfluxDB currently has 750,000 users deploying InfluxDB\u2019s cloud service, with 6,000 new users every month,\u201d Kaplan added while declining to reveal the company\u2019s burn rate or annual recurring revenue. \u201cIn a sign of our continued growth, InfluxData currently has roughly 165 employees and expects to expand its employee base by about 10% by the end of 2023.\u201d\nWith the closure of the Series E, InfluxData\u2019s total equity funding stands at $171 million.","31":"\nHighbeam, a startup that provides banking features, credit and cash flow insights to e-commerce customers, today announced that it raised $10 million in debt from TriplePoint as it looks to expand the reach of its digital product portfolio.\nCo-founders Samir Shergill (previously at Microsoft, McKinsey and AppNexus) and Gautam Gupta (formerly of Shopify, Venmo and Alloy) spent years working with e-commerce firms to help them scale. Together, they arrived at the conclusion that while online brands have been built to maximize revenue growth, aided by a surge in tech and marketing solutions, e-commerce is inherently capital-intensive and low-margin. The missing link to building a sustainable business, they believed, was effective cash management and responsible credit utilization.\n\u201cHaving seen firsthand the frustration dealing with legacy banks, accounting firms and predatory cash advances, we decided to build a banking platform for e-commerce that allows brand operators to manage cash flow in real time, access fair and transparent credit and grow profitably,\u201d Shergill said.\nTo that end, Highbeam \u2014 which typically works with \u201cfounder-led\u201d companies with greater than $1 million in revenue \u2014 provides a range of financial services and tools centered around e-commerce brand needs. Using the platform, customers can create bank accounts, take advantage of free wire transfers and get a debit card with 2% cash back on all purchases. (Highbeam works with Blue Ridge Bank to provide the banking services and debit card and The Currency Cloud on payment services.) Via a dashboard, Highbeam also shows insights and forecasts on business expenses (e.g. inventory, hiring and sales acquisition), leveraging algorithms that automatically categorize revenue and spend transactions.\nThe metrics go deeper. Highbeam\u2019s \u201cvendor view\u201d gives brands a real-time overview of where, exactly, their money is going. Spend tracking analytics alert customers as vendor costs fluctuate, giving them a chance to manage expenses before they become too overwhelming.\nHighbeam\u2019s analytics dashboard for e-commerce.\nHighbeam\u2019s analytics dashboard for e-commerce.\nHighbeam\u2019s credit product is a flat-rate, revenue-based line of credit that lets customers draw down and pay back loans on-demand. Shergill argues that it\u2019s a major differentiator in that it\u2019s \u201cfair and flexible\u201d versus a fee-based merchant cash advance, which tend to be more expensive and rigid in their terms.\u00a0\nFor context, Highbeam rival Wayflyer adopts a similar approach to e-commerce loans \u2014 using analytics and sending merchants cash to make inventory purchases or investments in their business. Merchants repay the loans using a percentage of their revenue until the money is paid back; merchants are using their revenue to get financing, hence the term revenue-based financing.\nThe advantage, companies like Highbeam and Wayfler claim, is that retailers make repayments as a percentage of their sales. If they have a slow month, they\u2019ll pay back less.\n\u201cFor many brands, today\u2019s economic headwinds have led to significant uncertainty around sales and inventory planning,\u201d Shergill said. \u201cHighbeam\u2019s e-commerce focus helps brands establish strong financial fundamentals by making effective cash planning and spend management easier.\u201d\nHighbeam sees itself competing with a wide range of fintech vendors including merchant cash advance providers like Shopify Capital (and also the aforementioned Wayflyer, Clearco and Onramp Funds); spend management and accounting services like Quickbooks; and corporate card firms such as Ramp and Brex. Ambitious? Perhaps \u2014 particularly for a firm with only $7 million in capital under its belt. (Highbeam raised $7 million last spring from Mayfield and FirstMark.) But Shergill insists that Highbeam\u2019s expanding at a rapid clip, notching 30% growth month-over-month and annual cash flow in the hundreds of millions.\u00a0\nCertainly, Highbeam\u2019s market \u2014 e-commerce \u2014 shows no sign of slowing down. Statista estimates that revenue from U.S.-based e-commerce hit $905 billion in 2022 and predicts that it\u2019ll reach $1.78 trillion by 2027. Online shopping remains one of the strongest and fastest-growing digital sectors, spawning multimillion-worth new businesses every year; a separate Statista report found that unicorn e-commerce startup companies made up an industry of almost $114 billion in 2021.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve grown mainly through customer referrals but will now ramp up hiring in our sales and customer success functions,\u201d Shergill said. \u201cHighbeam\u2019s core value proposition is to help brands make smarter decisions around profitability and cash flow, which is a key focus for everyone in this environment. Highbeam is well-positioned and funded to provide the tools brands need to grow sustainably and profitably.\u201d\nI must note, however, that Shergill didn\u2019t elaborate when asked why Highbeam chose to raise debt versus equity nor did he reveal the size of Highbeam\u2019s customer base. He also declined to give even a ballpark estimate of the company\u2019s annual recurring revenue, citing competitive reasons. Make of that what you will.","32":"\n\nCaldera, a no-code web3 infrastructure platform, raised $9 million across two rounds, its co-founder, Matt Katz, exclusively told TechCrunch.\nThe startup was founded in March 2022 by Katz and Parker Jou, CTO of Caldera, in an effort to simplify the process of creating app-specific blockchains so builders can create layer-2 blockchains in the span of hours, opposed to months or years, the team said.\n\u201cWe started the company when we realized developers wanted to build interesting things on the blockchain,\u201d Katz said. \u201cWe realized people actually want to build more complex things across a bunch of verticals and in order to unlock the full potential of web3, it\u2019s untenable for it to happen on a single blockchain.\u201d\nThe two rounds were led by Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire and Dragonfly Capital investment partner Ani Pai, with participation from Neo, 1kx and Ethereal Ventures. The capital will be used to \u201crapidly accelerate\u201d its development timeline, Katz said. It will also hire a team to strengthen its core product and improve the user interface so anyone can use it from \u201csmall hackathon teams to large crypto projects.\u201d\nThe startup aims to help web3 projects launch customizable layer-2 blockchains on the Ethereum blockchain so that it could scale the ecosystem in an easier way.\nImage Credits: Caldera (opens in a new window)\nImage Credits: Caldera (opens in a new window)\nThe platform is live on mainnet with select partners in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming space for both Ethereum and Polygon blockchains, but plans to be in public beta mode \u201cin the span of a month\u201d and widely available by summer, Katz said.\n\u201cFor us, we don\u2019t require any coding knowledge,\u201d Katz said. \u201cIf you just wanted a blockchain to say you had a blockchain \u2014 you could totally do that with our platform. The people we are targeting though are web3 developers who know how to write Ethereum smart contracts but don\u2019t know how the underlying blockchain works.\u201d\nCaldera aims to gain users who have a strong understanding of writing smart contracts, but don\u2019t have time to expand that knowledge multiple layers deeper, Katz added. Teams building DeFi gaming, consumer applications, music NFTs, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and institutional use cases have all shown \u201csustained interest\u201d in using the product, Katz said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping we can usher in a small mini explosion of projects building their own app chains,\u201d Katz said. He declined to share which projects the platform is working with currently, but said there will be announcements to come from those building on Caldera.\n\u201cThere\u2019s all these pieces of infrastructure that will be hard to get if you\u2019re creating your own blockchain,\u201d Katz said. \u201cOur goal is to be an all-in-one solution that will provide infrastructure so developers can hit the ground running and focus on building their app.\u201d","33":"\nStartup competitions are a mainstay in Silicon Valley, and there probably isn\u2019t a VC or founder out there who hasn\u2019t heard of Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt.\nFrom the TechCrunch Podcast Network comes Inside Startup Battlefield \u2014 a four-episode miniseries that takes you behind the scenes of one of tech\u2019s most anticipated startup competitions.

But maybe the real winner was us, the viewers, who did not have to sit through a bunch of crypto ads this year. (Also, Rihanna. She won.)\nThese ads offer an insight into the way that the companies we write about everyday market themselves to the average consumer \u2014 and sometimes they can be intensely prescient time capsules. See: last year\u2019s FTX ad starring America\u2019s favorite curmudgeon, Larry David, who underestimates the potential of innovations like the lightbulb and the dishwasher \u2014 and he makes the same \u201cmistake\u201d by choosing not to invest with FTX. In retrospect, the \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d star\u2019s intuition was pretty, pretty, pretty good.\nThis year, with crypto ads (mostly) out of the way, we got back to the basics with advertisements from tech companies that actually sell real things.\nGoogle gave us a classic Super Bowl commercial, starring celebrities who offer a clear illustration of what the technology does. The premise of the commercial is that these stars \u2014 Amy Schumer, Doja Cat, and Giannis Antetokounmpo \u2014 are delighted by the Magic Eraser feature on the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 pro, which lets users easily edit out unwanted people or objects from their favorite photos.\nThroughout the commercial, we watch how the Magic Eraser can edit photos. But some of these photos are made worse! In one snowy scene of a mother and child, we see how you can edit out the family dog, who is pooping in the background. In another, Magic Eraser can edit out the graphic on someone\u2019s t-shirt, which says \u201cthis guy loves to fart.\u201d We get how the feature works, but why not embrace the serendipity? Family photos are precious, but a family photo with the dog taking a dump in the corner of the frame? Priceless.\nNetflix just announced a partnership with General Motors, which will enable the streaming giant to use more electric vehicles (EVs) in their original content. In front of the Super Bowl audience, the two companies made their alliance known. Throughout the commercial, we see Will Ferrell making cameos \u2014 often alongside an EV \u2014 in Netflix originals like \u201cSquid Game,\u201d \u201cStranger Things,\u201d \u201cQueer Eye\u201d and \u201cBridgerton.\u201d The joke is that EVs are not always a good fit. In \u201cBridgerton,\u201d which takes place in the 1800s, Ferrell assures us that we \u201cshall\u2019nt\u201d see an EV (there is an EV behind him as he says this.) But the partnership might make more sense in a show like \u201cQueer Eye,\u201d where we see the Fab 5 drive around in their van to change the lives of some unsuspecting \u201cheroes.\u201d Netflix argues, why shouldn\u2019t that van be electric?\nThe streaming service Tubi, a division of Fox Entertainment, made an impression on Super Bowl Sunday. In a fifteen-second ad spot, the commercial makes it look like the game is back on, featuring two sports announcers making some brief, generic comments. Then, suddenly, it appears as though someone has pulled up the Tubi menu and is changing the channel. Surely, this spawned a few shouting matches at some Super Bowl parties. Or, if you\u2019re like us, maybe you were worried that you sat on your remote. Disruptive as it was, the ad worked \u2014 it was one of the most memorable commercials of the game.\n\u201cDiddy don\u2019t do jingles.\u201d In a meeting, some Uber executives dare ask P. Diddy (Sean Combs) to write a jingle for the company\u2019s Super Bowl ad. In an expert act of corporate trickery, the executives assure the musician that this is not a jingle: it\u2019s a hit song. It\u2019s just\u2026 a hit song about Uber. Or, one hit for Uber One, if you will.\nThen, we see a series of guests hit the recording booth, with an enthusiastic Diddy nodding along by the soundboard. Playing on the name Uber One, Diddy is giving another chance to some one-hit wonders, like Welsh singer Donna Lewis and the team behind \u201cWhat Does The Fox Say.\u201d\nSince the last Super Bowl, Uber shut down its free rewards program in exchange for the paid Uber One membership \u2014 so it makes sense that they\u2019d promote the service now.\nDoorDash took out an advertisement to remind consumers that they don\u2019t just deliver take out \u2014 they can also deliver your groceries (even though they ended a four-year partnership with Walmart last summer). Whoever conceptualized this ad is really trying to reach as many demographics as possible. We see celebrity appearances from three different \u201cchefs:\u201d Raekwon The Chef of the Wu-Tang Clan, celebrity chef Matty Matheson and the Nickelodeon animated Tiny Chef.\nIf you ask anyone to guess who the enterprise SaaS company Workday would hire to perform in their Super Bowl commercial, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019d come up with Paul Stanley from Kiss. This partnership comes so far out of left field that it\u2019s into the parking lot, but that\u2019s what makes the ad work.\n\u201cHey, corporate types, would you stop calling each other rock stars?\u201d Stanley demands in full Kiss makeup, a roaring crowd behind him.\n\u201cOh, Ted in finance \u2014 you\u2019re a rockstar!\u201d Ozzy Osbourne mocks. Workday also snagged appearances from rock icons like Billy Idol, Joan Jett and Gary Clark Jr.\nWorkday knows that there is nothing less punk than an enterprise SasS company, and you know what? Self-awareness is a rare thing in tech. Thank you, Workday.\n\u201cSquarespace is a website that makes websites?\u201d asks Adam Driver. At my Super Bowl party, that opening line of the commercial is where our attention ended. Instead, we initiated a spirited debate about whether or not we think Adam Driver is hot. Alas, this is the risk of a particularly compelling celebrity appearance.\nWatching the commercial back now, I declare this the best ad of the night. It\u2019s weird. The concept of a website that makes websites is so meta (no, not that Meta) that something breaks in the fabric of the universe \u2014 Squarespace is the singularity, and now there are an infinite number of Adam Drivers.\nFor the record, Adam Driver is, in fact, hot.\nSpeaking of meta, the company formerly known as Facebook made an appearance in this year\u2019s commercials, but it wasn\u2019t as striking as last year\u2019s very depressing and cringe-worthy ad about out-of-work animatronics hanging out in Horizon Worlds. Instead, Keke Palmer takes a drive through the metaverse to explain what that word even means. The ad was not memorable, but for Meta, that\u2019s maybe a victory in itself.\nAmazon\u2019s 90-second spot featuring a lonely dog who gets a new companion performed well, according to USA Today\u2019s panel, which ranked the sentimental \u201cSaving Sawyer\u201d ad at No. 3. The ad didn\u2019t feature Amazon\u2019s brand much, beyond a quick moment where the family picked out a new dog kennel for Sawyer via Amazon\u2019s retail website which later arrived in an oversized box.\nNetflix to include more EVs in its TV shows and movies as part of new partnership with GM\n\nHere\u2019s Google\u2019s Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, starting at $599 and $899\n","35":"\nTwilio just announced that it will be conducting a round of layoffs that will impact around 17% of its global workforce. The company will also restructure its internal organization and create two business units \u2014\u00a0Twilio Communications and Twilio Data & Applications.\nToday\u2019s news must be particularly difficult for Twilio employees as the company already conducted a round of layoffs in September, 2022. At the time, the company announced that it would lay off 11% of its staff.\nAccording to Twilio\u2019s latest earnings release, the company had 8,992 employees as of September 30, 2022 and expected to lay off 816 employees for the 2022 round of layoffs. Based on these figures, around 1,400 people will be impacted by this year\u2019s layoffs.\n\u201cWe have to spend less, streamline, and become more efficient. To do that, we\u2019re forming two business units: Twilio Communications and Twilio Data & Applications. And today, I\u2019m unfortunately bearing the news that we\u2019re parting ways with approximately 17% of our team,\u201d Twilio co-founder and CEO Jeff Lawson wrote in an email sent to all Twilio employees.\nWhile Twilio started with application programming interfaces (APIs) that let you send and receive phone calls and text messages, the company has expanded its product portfolio through several acquisitions and product developments. For instance, Twilio acquired Segment to move deeper into marketing data and customer engagement services in general. According to the company\u2019s CEO, these products haven\u2019t reached the same maturity level.\n\u201cIn Communications, we have to get more efficient. For Segment, Flex, and Engage, we must accelerate growth. These are distinctly different tasks for our teams, and our current structure is slowing our progress toward both these goals, which are critical to our growth, our profit, and our Customer Engagement Platform ambitions,\u201d Lawson wrote.\nEach business unit will have its own president \u2014 Elena Donio for Data & Applications, and Khozema Shipchandler for Communications. Each division will also have its own sales, R&D and admin resources. With this clear line, it becomes easier to conduct different strategies for each part of the business.\nThe Communications side of the business seems to be particularly affected by today\u2019s layoffs. \u201cWhen we look at these two business units on their own, it\u2019s clear that we\u2019ve gotten too big, especially in Communications. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re also letting go of some colleagues today,\u201d Lawson wrote.\nAffected employees will receive 12 weeks of base pay plus one week for every year of service, as well as health coverage and career resources. The company is also ending some benefits, such as book and wellness allowances as well as Twilio Recharge \u2014 a four-week paid sabbatical that employees would get every three years.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also decided to sunset Twilio Recharge, which I believe in, but which (in retrospect) was ill-timed given our profitability goals,\u201d Lawson wrote.\nPaperwork filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows that the board will lower Jeff Lawson\u2019s annual base salary from $134,000 per year to $65,535. Twilio expects to spend $100 to $135 million in charges related to the workforce reduction. There will be additional costs associated with office closures.\nTwilio shares are currently trading up 2.8% compared to Friday\u2019s closing price.

The RAM 1500 REV, as it\u2019s called, is Stellantis\u2019 first entry into the growing electric pickup wars.\u00a0The concept debuted last month at the 2023 Consumer Electronic Show, but few details, including interior features, were revealed then. This is the first time the company has publicly displayed the production version.\nAccording to the Super Bowl ad, the RAM 1500 REV will be packed with screens and, surprisingly, buttons and knobs. The interior of the electric RAM is similar to that of the gas-powered RAM.\nThe center stack features a giant, vertical touchscreen flanked by physical buttons for climate control, media playback and truck controls. In addition, there are three screens in the front \u2014 dash cluster, infotainment screen and even a screen embedded under the passenger-side airbag (this is available in the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Cherokee). Like traditional RAM trucks, gear selection appears to be done through a sizeable twisty knob mounted on the dash.\n[gallery ids=\"2484406,2484405,2484404,2484403,2484402,2484401,2484400,2484399,2484398,2484397,2484396,2484395,2484394,2484393,2484392\"]\nLast month at CES, the RAM 1500 REV concept featured a dual motor affair and 350kW fast charging. It\u2019s still being determined if that same setup will appear in the production version.\nThere are still two significant details missing: price and electric range. There\u2019s still time, though. The RAM 1500 REV is scheduled for a 2025 model release, which will likely hit dealerships in late 2024. By that time, the RAM 1500 REV will face established competitors. Ford started selling its electric pickup, the F-150 Lightning, in 2022 and is rumored to be building another EV pickup based on the compact Maverick. General Motors started selling its first electric pickup, the Hummer EV, in 2022, and will begin rolling out the more affordable Silverado EV in the second half 2023. The Tesla Cybertruck is still unknown. The company debuted the Cybertruck at a flash event in 2019, but it keeps pushing the release. As of publication, Tesla allows customers to preorder a Cybertruck, but does not list an estimated delivery date.\nStellantis has yet to reveal details about the RAM 1500 REV\u2019s platform. It\u2019s unclear now if it\u2019s built on the BEV-centric STLA Frame platform or something different. This detail is critical for hauling and towing capabilities.\nRAM is ready to take customers\u2019 money for a spot in line. It costs $100 to reserve the right to preorder the truck, also granting access to exclusive events, news and information.\nAlso, I have questions and concerns about the new giant, glowing RAM logo. The typeface and kerning are slightly different from the current logo, and it looks a lot like the new Kia logo, which isn\u2019t going over very well.\n\u00a0","38":"\nOn-demand shuttle service and transit tech company Via has raised another $110 million, bringing the company\u2019s total funding to around $1 billion. The fresh capital pushes Via\u2019s valuation up to $3.5 billion at the same price per share as the company\u2019s previous financing in November of 2021.\nVia intends to use the funds to further its vision of being \u201cable to provide every city in the world access to this end-to-end digital infrastructure, where they can plan, operate, analyze and continue to optimize their transit networks across every vertical in that transit network,\u201d Daniel Ramot, Via\u2019s CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch.\nVia\u2019s transit tech software helps public transportation agencies, municipalities and school districts optimize fixed bus routes, strategize placements of new bike lanes, plan paratransit and school bus services, and holistically incorporate private on-demand ridesharing services into a city\u2019s entire transportation ecosystem. The company has already scaled to 600 communities and more than 35 countries.\nAs new mobility segments continue to emerge, threatening to cramp already congested streets and decimate already tight budgets, Ramot thinks the startup can do more.\nEither through in-house development or mergers and acquisitions, Via wants to use the funds to add more products to its suite of tools. The company is still considering its options, but a few ideas Ramot and I tossed around include expanding Via\u2019s street map making software to include planning for traffic lights and speed bumps; adding parking and curb management software; managing fleets of electric vehicles and their many chargers; integrating micromobility planning; and incorporating autonomous vehicles into the mix.\nVia is currently working with AV companies Motional and May Mobility to deploy autonomous ridesharing shuttles in Las Vegas, Nevada and Grand Rapids, Minnesota, respectively.\n\u201cThe idea would be that you\u2019d use our tools to plan the infrastructure in the most effective, safest, most efficient way, and then design the transit network that sits on top of that infrastructure,\u201d Ramot told TechCrunch. \u201cPotentially we\u2019d be interested in control access, also. Right of way through traffic lights, for example \u2014 if you have a bus show up at a traffic light with 50 people on it, and then a car with one person, the traffic light\u2019s not smart enough to give the bus right of way, but you would probably want it to do that. And those are just supply\/demand-matching algorithms, which our system is very good at doing.\u201d\nVia\u2019s fundraise comes at a time when startups are thirsty for fresh cash and investors are being picky. Ramot says Via is, in some ways, at the right place at the right time \u2014 transit agencies are still reeling from the effects of COVID-19 on ridership patterns, and they\u2019re more amenable to being ushered into the 21st century with digital tools and datasets.\n\u201cIn the past, it\u2019s been very difficult to convince cities and transit agencies to adopt new technology, to transition to more dynamically routed or data-driven services,\u201d said Ramot. \u201cI won\u2019t say it\u2019s easy, but it\u2019s become easier.\u201d\nVia has also been able to show investors that it\u2019s got a sustainable business. The company said it ended 2022 with an annualized revenue run-rate surpassing $200 million, which is more than double since its previous $130 million financing round in November 2021.\nThat\u2019s around the time Via confidentially filed to go public. The company has yet to move forward on that given the market volatility of the past year, but Ramot said Via is very much prepared to make its debut once the market opens up and if it makes sense to do so. While Via didn\u2019t need to raise more funds to continue operating at its current clip, the funds also give the startup the \u201coptionality\u201d to go public when the timing is right, says Ramot.\nThe $110 million came from a combination of new and existing investors. 83North led the round, with participation from Exor N.V., Pitango, Janus Henderson, CF Private Equity, Planven Entrepreneur Ventures, Riverpark Ventures and ION Crossover Partners.\nVia files confidentially to go public\n","39":"\nIt\u2019s a cold February across much of the U.S., but this hot newsflash should warm the cockles of every entrepreneur\u2019s heart.
