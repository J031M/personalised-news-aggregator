The new features, which are rolling out globally, were announced today to mark Safer Internet Day.One of the new features is called \u201cIncognito Mode\u201d and is a step up from fully hiding your profile. Members can still Like and Nope in the app, but only those whom they\u2019ve Liked will see them in their recommendations. The feature is designed to allow users to take complete control over who sees them while scrolling through profiles on Tinder. Incognito Mode is a premium feature available for Tinder+, Gold and Premium members.Image Credits: TinderImage Credits: Tinder\u201cIncognito Mode is a new way of being able to control your experience,\u201d Rory Kozoll, Tinder\u2019s VP of Product and Integrity, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been able to hide your profile on Tinder, but we wanted to create a feature that lets people hide their profile, but still be able to see everybody else and only get shown to the people they like.\u201dThe company is also launching a new \u201cBlock Profile\u201d feature that gives users the option to choose who they want to see on Tinder. Now, when profiles are suggested, before matching, users can block them so they don\u2019t show up again. Tinder notes that the feature provides an easy way to avoid seeing a boss or an ex on the app. The new feature is launching in addition to the current \u201cBlock Contacts\u201d feature that lets users can determine which of their contacts they\u2019d rather not see, or not be seen by on Tinder.Image Credits: TinderImage Credits: TinderIn addition, Tinder is making it easier for users to report bad behavior by introducing \u201cLong Press Reporting.\u201d Long press reporting lets people tap and hold offensive messages, launching the reporting flow directly in the chat experience. The company says that by simplifying the reporting process, it hopes more users will report bad behavior on the app.Last, Tinder is updating its \u201cDoes This Bother you?\u201d and \u201cAre You Sure\u201d prompts to include more language that it classifies as being harmful. The Are You Sure? prompt appears before a message is sent when Tinder detects harmful language. The Does This Bother You? prompt encourages users to report inappropriate conversations so that the company can take action against users who break the app\u2019s rules. Now, the two features will cover more keywords, phrases and emojis that might be considered harmful.\u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve been introducing safety in every step,\u201d Kozoll said. \u201cFrom trying to understand the authenticity of our members and making sure members are being respectful towards each other. We see that whole journey as a place where we can help. And so today, we\u2019re looking at the latest features in that evolution.\u201dTinder is also launching Green Flags, a new campaign that highlights the safety features that it offers users, from creating a profile, to liking and matching, to chatting and to meeting up in real life. The company says the Green Flags campaign is an extension to Match Group\u2019s recent campaign that introduced in-app messages and email notifications to give users tips on how to prevent being scammed online.Tinder and other Match dating apps will offer in-app tips on avoiding romance scams","3":"The uptake of customer relationship management (CRM) tools has grown immensely over the last few years such that the market size is expected to experience a 12.5% compound annual growth rate, and to be worth $145.79 billion in the next six years. This growth is largely attributable to the uptick of online merchants using CRM tools to boost sales, increase profits and beat mounting competition from other providers.One such platform that is helping consumer brands leverage their data to grow is Gameball, a customer intelligence and marketing CRM platform, that was launched in 2020 by egyptian entrepreneurs Ahmed Khairy (CEO) Ahmed El Assy (CPO), and Omar Alfar\u00a0(CTO).Gameball says brands use its tools to build long-term relationships with customers and ensure retention through personalized loyalty programs that are informed by data.Khairy told TechCrunch that since the startup\u2019s launch, growth has been exponential and they have so far served over 7,000 businesses reaching 20 million customers. The startup plans to grow this further by embarking on a marketing drive and setting up hubs in regions where its platform is on demand over the next one year.Gameball\u2019s expansion drive is backed by a $3.5 million seed funding it has raised from 500 Global, P1 Ventures, Launch Africa, and Middle East VCs Seedra Ventures, Arzan Ventures, Propeller, Core Vision, as well as a number of regional investors.\u201cMoving forward we are focusing more on commercializing the product. We are also trying to focus on certain countries that will give us access to certain regions\u2026like the U.K to give us access to Europe, and Saudi Arabia for the GCC region,\u201d said Khairy.\u201cWe have been seeing a lot of growth coming from those markets, and beyond being mature markets, it\u2019s easier for them to adopt solutions and technologies like Gameball. Their economies are kind of stable, enabling us to better leverage them for growth.\u201dHisham Halbouny, general partner at P1 Ventures, said: \u201cThe consumer landscape is evolving rapidly with brands competing for customer engagement, trust and retention. Gameball is solving a large multi-billion-dollar challenge that can transform digital marketing, customer loyalty and monetization around the world. We are thrilled to back the team on their journey as they grow their footprint in new markets.\u201dKhairy, Assy and Alfar, started building Gameball as a Shopify app, before moving on to build an API solution for businesses outside Shopify.Khairy says clients using their platform can carry out multi-channel marketing campaigns, run loyalty programs, build customer profiles for targeted promotions and rewards for increased engagement.\u201cOur clients have a lot of channels and interaction points with the customers but bringing all those things together in a single dashboard, where they can actually have better visibility on their customer behavior and customer insights and then use this data to run efficient marketing campaigns is one the biggest pain for our customers. So, we started building for that problem,\u201d said Khairy.Gameball\u2019s clientele include Sega, Xiaomi, Experience Philippines and Breadfast. Image Credit: Gameball.Gameball\u2019s clientele include Sega, Xiaomi, Experience Philippines and Breadfast. Image Credit: Gameball.Khairy added that through analyzing customer behavior, Gameball is able to give brands monetization opportunities, and help them upsell and cross-sell efficiently across their customer base.\u201cWe empower marketers to get better insights, data, and visibility on the customer behavior. We basically give them the tools to run the retention and marketing campaigns more efficiently based on this data, and to personalize and make more money out of those relationships,\u201d he said.He added that the platform helps brands to tap existing customers, who are capable of bringing greater value to businesses than new customers. Besides, businesses no longer require to spend blindly on customer acquisition through paid ads as they have an opportunity to tap existing ones via targeted campaigns and loyalty programs.Gameball\u2019s customers cut across all sectors including ecommerce, retail, and fintech. Its clientele include Sega, Xiaomi, Experience Philippines and Breadfast.","4":"Highlighting the plastic industry\u2019s infamous track record on recycling, London-based Recycleye says it raised $17 million in new funding led by \u201cdeep tech\u201d investor DCVC.The startup claims its recycling-picking robots can identify materials \u201cat an unrivaled 60 frames per second\u201d and sort them more accurately than humans can. Ultimately, the startup says its tech cuts the \u201ccost of sorting materials.\u201d TechCrunch has reached out to the company for information on its projected cost savings.Based in Palo Alto, DCVC says its mission is to \u201cmultiply the benefits of capitalism for everyone while reducing its costs.\u201d Climate tech is one of its focuses, and one lens through which we can see capitalism\u2019s environmental toll. In the case of plastics, the oil industry has long preached the virtues of plastic recycling, while doubting its economic viability, in order to sell more virgin plastic.Every stage of plastic production disrupts the climate and natural world, from \u201cthe extraction and transport of the fossil fuels that are the primary feedstocks for plastic, to refining and manufacturing, to waste management, to the plastic that enters the environment,\u201d the Center for International Environmental Law wrote in 2019.Plastic pollution \u2014 a major climate change driver \u2014 is rising, too. That is due in part to shortfalls in \u201cwaste management and recycling,\u201d OECD, an intergovernmental body, said last year. The group concluded that someone needs to \u201ccreate a separate and well-functioning market for recycled plastics.\u201d The trouble is: Sorting, melting and ultimately reusing most plastic \u2014 which you can only recycle a couple of times \u2014 is way costlier than buying virgin plastic. Much of the time, we simply don\u2019t do it. Most plastic (about 91%, per OECD) is not recycled and\u00a0single-use plastic production is at an all-time high.By focusing on speeding up scanning, identifying and sorting used materials, Recycleye is one among many companies that are attempting to fix part of this broken system with AI. Citing OECD\u2019s report, Recycleye said, \u201cChanging this wasteful and environmentally damaging dynamic, seen across a range of materials, presents a tremendous business opportunity.\u201dRecycleye says its machine learning and scanning tech \u201cis twice as fast as the industry standard and means that each item is seen on average 30 times as it passes along the conveyor belt, with double the chance of being accurately identified before picking.\u201d We\u2019ve reached out to the company for more context on these figures.Several other investors chipped in on Recycleye\u2019s new Series A funding round, including London-based early-stage investor Playfair Capital.","5":"Apple\u2019s M series chips were incredibly well telegraphed when they arrived in late 2021. Apple had been designing its own silicon since the A4 appeared in the iPhone 4 just over a decade earlier. The appearance of Apple\u2019s in-house efforts in the Mac was really just a question of when, not if.When the M1 came, it landed with a resonating bang. In addition to being genuinely noticeably faster, the chips were seen as a big step forward for portable computing because of their shockingly improved \u201cperformance per watt\u201d that allowed for full-speed processing while on battery power with increased usage times.Apple has just launched the next iteration of the M line with this year\u2019s M2 MacBook Pro and Mac mini models \u2014 officially denoting this as an ongoing series rather than a one-off leap. With confirmed 20% improvements in CPU and 30% in GPU performance in under 2 years and a really aggressive entry price point, the M2 adds to Apple\u2019s lead in portable chipsets.I was able to spend a bit of time talking to Apple\u2019s vice president of Platform Architecture and Hardware Technologies Tim Millet, as well as VP of Worldwide Product Marketing Bob Borchers about the impact of the M chips so far, how they see the line developing over time and a bit about gaming too.\u201cA lot of it comes down to the people and the talent on Tim\u2019s team,\u201d says Borchers, \u201cbut I think a lot of it also comes down to the way that we\u2019ve approached designing Apple silicon from the very beginning.\u201dMillet has been building chips for 30 years and has been at Apple for nearly 17. He says that with M1, Apple saw an opportunity to \u201creally hit it.\u201d\u201cThe opportunity we had with M1 the way I looked at it, it was about resetting the baseline.\u201dWhen their desktop computing and laptop computing pipeline was essentially controlled by the third-party merchants and silicon vendors, it didn\u2019t really allow for Apple to push the bar closer to the limits of technology.This need to own and \u201creset\u201d the baseline of portable performance in computing coalesced around the time that Apple started working on the iPad Pro. They had been building chips inside of these super-thin enclosures and knew that, with ready power and much larger casings, they could make a significant impact on portable computing.\u201cOnce we started getting to the iPad Pro space, we realized that \u2018you know what, there is something there.\u2019 We never, in building the chips for iOS devices, left anything on the table. But we realized that these chips inside these other enclosures could actually make a meaningful difference from a performance perspective. And so with M1 we were super excited about the opportunity to have that big impact \u2014 shifting all of it back up to redefining what it meant to have a laptop in many different ways.\u201d \n\n\t\t\t\u201cThe opportunity we had with M1 the way I looked at it, it was about resetting the baseline.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTim Millet, Apple VP\n\n\nThe work that Apple did with the M1 wasn\u2019t focused on pure peak performance, says Millet. From the beginning, there was this idea that they\u2019d be able to reset user expectations around what kind of performance you should be able to get out of a portable computer, and for how long. The focus on performance per watt paid off (as noted in my early review of Apple\u2019s first M1 chip), in that people could run major compute tasks on laptops untethered from power for hours. No compromises. That, says Millet, wasn\u2019t a byproduct \u2014 it was the intent from the beginning.\u201cWe wanted to have the ability to build a scale of solutions that deliver the absolute maximum performance for machines that had no fan; for machines that had active cooling systems like our pro class machines. We wanted to\u2026move performance per watt to the point where we delivered real usable performance in these in a wide range of machines.\u201dApple vice president of Platform Architecture and Hardware Technologies Tim MilletApple vice president of Platform Architecture and Hardware Technologies Tim MilletMillet says that Apple was pleased with what it had been able to ship with M1 and that it served those goals. My own experiences and those of power-hungry users mirrored that sentiment once the machines began to ship. For decades, Apple had been running up against third-party stewardship over chipset speeds, power requirements and features \u2014 with the result of increasingly less mobile computers that ran hot, loud and short. The whole portable industry had been constricting that flexibility for so long that most users (aside from those of us who spend our lives closely examining these boundaries) probably didn\u2019t realize how hard it was for them to breathe.The M1 whacked a big old reset button on those restrictions, putting portable back into the power computing lexicon. And with M2, Millet says, Apple did not want to milk a few percentage points of gains out of each generation in perpetuity.\u201cThe M2 family was really now about maintaining that leadership position by pushing, again, to the limits of technology. We don\u2019t leave things on the table,\u201d says Millet. \u201cWe don\u2019t take a 20% bump and figure out how to spread it over three years\u2026figure out how to eke out incremental gains. We take it all in one year; we just hit it really hard. That\u2019s not what happens in the rest of the industry or historically.\u201dBorchers chimes in to note that Apple is building products, not parts. This gives it a much tighter loop between needs and deliverables. He notes that the pairing of the technology and product is not an independent choice at Apple; it\u2019s silicon, software and hardware coming together, starting at the point of inception. It\u2019s not \u201cCan we do this?\u201d and then waiting to see if a vendor can deliver the appropriate capability.\u201cAs somebody who\u2019s been building silicon for 30-plus years, the luxury of knowing what the target is, and working side by side with the product designers, the hardware system team, the software people to understand exactly what you\u2019re aiming at, makes all the difference in our ability to really target and make sure we\u2019re adding things that matter, not adding anything that doesn\u2019t,\u201d Millet agrees.For much of the modern history of the Mac, after Apple moved from PowerPC to x86 in 2006, it has had less immediate control over capability in its machines. Whatever it hoped to accomplish with a new machine, it had to include an external factor in there, with external partners like Intel delivering on their own timelines and complexities. There was a forcing function in place. That partner is telling you, \u201cThis is what we can deliver you on your scale in this timeframe for these applications,\u201d which cascades all the way through to product design and development.Apple retaking control of its silicon pipeline also reset the size and complexity of that development feedback loop, which prompts me to ask them whether that relationship has changed internally at Apple post-M1.\u201cIf you go back to the phone, we had that tight interaction really, from the very beginning \u2014 and I think that\u2019s true for all of the iOS products. We had that tight feedback loop,\u201d says Millet.Both Millet and Borchers are diplomatic about the Intel partnership (which is till present, for now, in Apple\u2019s Mac Pro machines).\u201cIntel was a great partner through the years where we shipped the Intel machines. They were very responsive; they really actually were inspired by the direction that Apple pushed them. And I think our products benefited from that interaction. Of course, our competitors\u2019 products benefited from that interaction as well sometimes,\u201d notes Millet.But, undoubtedly, the relationship between what Apple wants to ship and what it can ship has been radically altered now that the M-series chips are in the breadth of its lineup. Apple\u2019s chip team working closely with internal teams has been a natural part of Apple\u2019s device pipeline since it began work on the iPhone 4. Now that system has expanded to envelop the Mac branch as well.\u201cI think it felt very natural for us to sit down side by side with our industrial design partners and our system team partners inside Apple because they\u2019re familiar faces to us,\u201d Millet says. \u201cThese are people that we\u2019ve been working with for iPad and iPhone. And it really felt very, very natural. It\u2019s a very Apple way of working where we are all sitting at the table together, imagining possibilities and them challenging us and us going back and doing the math to kind of figure out that \u2018yeah, I think we can do that without a fan.\u2019\u201dBorchers sparks on my use of the term \u201cfeedback loop\u201d and notes that it\u2019s less that the loop is smaller and instead that it has been eliminated.\u201c[That term] implies some sense of latency or delay in the cycle,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think that it\u2019s an appropriate way of thinking when you\u2019ve got multiple parties involved. I think that the big difference here is that we move from having a feedback loop to co-creation, where there isn\u2019t a feedback loop\u2026You [just] sit down at a table and push each other. Okay, well, what if we got rid of the fan? And it doesn\u2019t require this latency in the system, which I think has efficiency gains, but it also unleashes your creativity in new ways. So I actually think you hit on something interesting there in kind of this difference between a feedback loop and a different kind of process.\u201dApple M2 Max features 67 billion transistors, 400GB\/s of unified memory bandwidth, and up to 96GB of fast, low-latency unified memory. (Image: Apple)Apple M2 Max features 67 billion transistors, 400GB\/s of unified memory bandwidth, and up to 96GB of fast, low-latency unified memory. (Image: Apple)One arena still holds fascination for any of us who have found a home on the Mac for nearly every part of our digital life \u2014 save one: gaming. The M-series Macs are undoubtedly more gaming capable than any previous Mac due to the inclusion of much-improved onboard GPUs across the lineup. But even with big titles popping up on Mac in spurts, there still is a fairly large section of \u201chere there be dragons,\u201d where you would think Apple would like to map in the multi-billion-dollar gaming market.Borchers says that Apple is feeling like the Apple silicon gaming story is getting more solid release by release.\u201cWith Capcom bringing Resident Evil across, and other titles starting to come along, I think the AAA community is starting to wake up and understand the opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause what we have now, with our portfolio of M-series Macs, is a set of incredibly performant machines and a growing audience of people who have these incredibly performant systems that can all be addressed with a single code base that is developing over time.\u201cAnd we\u2019re adding new APIs in and expanding Metal in Metal 3, etc. And then if you think about the ability to extend that down into iPad, and iPhone as well, I think there\u2019s tremendous opportunity.\u201dHe acknowledges that Apple needs to do work to bring game developers along the road to adoption, but he says the company is happy that they\u2019ve shipped the core ingredients in very performant systems. He says that the team has been and will continue to look at a variety of chip configurations and components through that gaming lens as well. Anyone who games on the Mac should find room for encouragement in the way Millet says that the team is focusing here, though time will tell.Millet says that Apple\u2019s work on cracking the gaming market started with the early days of the Apple silicon transition.\u201cThe story starts many years ago, when we were imagining this transition. Gamers are a serious bunch. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to fool anybody by saying that overnight we\u2019re going to make Mac a great gaming platform. We\u2019re going to take a long view on this.\u201dHe notes that Apple offers common building blocks that are shared, scaled appropriately, between the Mac, iPhone and iPad where Apple has historical strength. But he also points out that the purpose-built GPUs in the iOS devices weren\u2019t intended to be general use.\u201cWe weren\u2019t going to design GPUs for that space that were unnecessarily complicated, that had features that were not relevant to iOS,\u201d he notes. \u201cBut as we looked at the Mac, we realized that this is a different beast. There will be different expectations over time \u2014 let\u2019s make sure we have our toolbox complete.\u201cAnd so we did very directed work to make sure that the GPU toolbox was there \u2014 working super closely with our Metal partners. We worked hand in hand to make sure that they were going to have all the tools that they needed to accelerate the important APIs that we\u2019re going to deliver to [companies like] Capcom, for example. So that when Capcom approached us, it wasn\u2019t going to be this awkward port for them. It was going to be a very natural \u2018Ah, you do support these modern APIs that gamers are needing. This is interesting.\u2019\u201dThat, in turn, makes it simpler to approach game developers with a strong set of tools that feel familiar enough and compatible enough with their existing workflows to make porting games or building for the Mac viable.\u201cMy team spends a lot of time thinking about how to make sure that we\u2019re staying on that API curve to make sure that we\u2019re giving Metal what it needs to be a modern gaming API. We know this will take some time. But we\u2019re not at all confused about the opportunity; we see it. And we\u2019re going to make sure we show up.\u201dHe also acknowledges that it will take time to build an installed base of strong GPUs in order for it to be enticing to the AAA space.\u201cThe other thing we wanted to do, and I think we have hopefully done, is to seed the Mac, the full Mac lineup, with very capable GPUs, whether it be the MacBook Air, obviously, all the way up to the beast, Ultra chips that we can put in our Mac Studio.\u201d\u201cBecause until you do that, until you have a population distributed, developers are going to be wary about making a big investment and kind of focus on Mac,\u201d Millet acknowledges.So Apple will continue to seed the Mac population as people upgrade from Intel to M1 or M2, and it will, hopefully, become more and more obvious to developers that the Mac population at large has a machine that is capable of running major titles at a frame rate that is acceptable to gamers.Millet also is unconvinced that the game dev universe has adapted to the unique architecture of the M-series chips quite yet, especially the unified memory pool.\u201cGame developers have never seen 96 gigabytes of graphics memory available to them now, on the M2 Max. I think they\u2019re trying to get their heads around it, because the possibilities are unusual. They\u2019re used to working in much smaller footprints of video memory. So I think that\u2019s another place where we\u2019re going to have an interesting opportunity to inspire developers to go beyond what they\u2019ve been able to do before.\u201dThe custom technologies of M2 Pro and M2 Max include Apple\u2019s next-generation, 16-core Neural Engine and new powerful, efficient media engines with hardware-accelerated H.264, HEVC, and ProRes video encode and decode.

(Image: Apple)Historically, the most vibrant chatter about the Mac is about the next Mac. No matter what gains or features Apple delivers with a particular system, the question readers and friends are always hitting me with is, \u201cWhen is the next one coming, and is it worth waiting for?\u201d Lest you think it\u2019s just happening out here in user land, Millet says that he gets it, too.\u201cFriends and family reach out all the time and they say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m thinking about getting a new Mac, wink, wink. Is now a good time?\u2019 And what\u2019s beautiful about this story is that I really, with full sincerity, believe now is always a good time\u2026Nobody should be shy about it.\u201d \n\n\t\t\t\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to fool anybody by saying that overnight we\u2019re going to make Mac a great gaming platform. We\u2019re going to take a long view on this.\u201d\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTim Millet, Apple VP\n\n\n\tThis wave of updates from the Mac with M2 onboard are so impressive that it stops that sentiment short of being too self-serving. The broad consensus, in fact, is that the M2 Mac mini is probably the best-value computer that Apple has ever shipped \u2014 and may actually be the best value in desktop computing period. At $599 for the base model, it comes in at a lower price than the previous M1 model and is incredibly capable \u2014 clocking in at around 20% faster. Even with that nice positioning, however, the previous year\u2019s model remains more than viable for all of the use cases in that band.Apple has managed to find a sweet spot that allows the bulk of customers to \u201cbuy whenever,\u201d knowing that the M-series chips are indeed that good. Millet says that Apple knows that the top few percent of power-hungry users that want the edge on capability are savvy enough to know the rough release timeline of the \u201cnew Macs\u201d and will wait for it.\u201cThat 20% is going to make a big difference to some folks. Absolutely. And they will wait for that moment [when] they can see it because they have workloads that require it,\u201d Millet says, while noting that they\u2019re confident enough in the satisfaction levels of buyers of M1 that they\u2019re not going to hold off.\u201cIf you bought a MacBook Pro last year with M1, you\u2019re gonna be fine. [Even] if you bought it in December, you\u2019re not going to come screaming at me telling me I hate this machine, [and] why didn\u2019t you tell me to wait?\u201dOne rationale for shipping M2 is also that Apple wanted to establish the line in a regular cadence. It was important, Millet says, to make sure people didn\u2019t see the M1 as a \u201cone and done.\u201dAs far as the \u201cwhen Macs\u201d question goes, Millet and Borchers are both in the \u201cwhen possible, ship\u201d camp. Coming out of a period pre-M1, when many in the Mac ecosystem felt that it was being underinvested in, it\u2019s clear that Apple wants to send a message that this is not the case and they never want that to become a meme again.\u201cAs a silicon person, I know that technology moves fast and I don\u2019t want to wait around. I certainly want to push hard, as you can imagine,\u201d says Millet. \u201cWe want to get the technology into the hands of our system team as soon as possible, in the hands of our customer as soon as possible. We don\u2019t want to leave them wondering\u2026do they not care about us? A new phone shipped last year. Why didn\u2019t the Mac get the love?\u201d\u201cWe want to reset to the technology curve and then we want to live on it. We don\u2019t want the Mac to stray too far away from it.\u201dBorchers says that the opportunity for Apple lies in the fact that the vast majority of Mac customers are on Intel machines. This makes it less of an \u201cit\u2019s been a year, we have to ship something\u201d situation.\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it more and more of an easy decision to move\u2026to an even more amazing system,\u201d he says.When positioned year over year, the gains are absolutely solid. But if Apple is marketing to, and eyeballing the opportunity of, millions of current Intel Mac users, then the calculus (for them) becomes easier. As proud as the team is of the M1 to M2 speed jump, Borchers says, the real messaging is around the leap from just 2 years ago \u2014 especially for the Mac mini, where the leaps are in the 10x and up multiples of performance. All in a price that\u2019s $100 cheaper than the M1 Mac mini and $200 cheaper for students.\u201cWe\u2019re product people at the end of the day, and we want to put our systems in as many hands as possible,\u201d says Borchers. \u201cWe feel like the Mac mini form factor is such a great way to unleash creativity and, frankly, goodness in the world that we wanted to be able to put it in as many people\u2019s hands as possible.\u201cWe don\u2019t think about [Mac pricing] in a traditional kind of cookie-cutter way where it\u2019s like, \u2018Okay, it\u2019s 2023, we\u2019re going to $799 and we\u2019re going to be predictable.\u2019 It\u2019s more of what do we have [in the pipeline], and what can we do that will surprise and delight our customers?\u201d","6":"Five days after getting its streaming debut on Disney+, \u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\u201d is now the most-watched Marvel premiere on Disney+ based on hours streamed within the first five days, the company announced today.Disney didn\u2019t provide specific viewing numbers, so it\u2019s not exactly clear how the movie\u2019s streaming performance compares to other Marvel titles on Disney+. However, the claim means the \u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\u201d premiere performed better than popular franchises like \u201cBlack Widow\u201d and \u201cAvengers: Endgame.\u201dThe new streaming record for Disney+ could also mean that more Marvel films may get longer windows between theatrical release and streaming release \u2014 but that\u2019s just our guess. In general, movies that get a long theatrical window are more likely to stand out in the minds of viewers as opposed to streaming-exclusive movies that might not get as much hype. Disney+ subscribers had to wait 82 days for \u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\u201d to stream on Disney+, the longest window of any Marvel movie on the streamer. For comparison, \u201cThor: Love and Thunder\u201d appeared on Disney+ 62 days after it premiered in theaters.The \u201cBlack Panther\u201d sequel was released in theaters on November 11, 2022, and grossed over $800 million at the box office worldwide.

Certainly it butts up against similar questions around art and creativity as AI projects like DALL-E and ChatGPT \u2014 though the question is arguably even more in your face when it\u2019s a robot arm doing the painting on a real-world canvas.I recognize this is all extremely subjective, but at this point in the process, I\u2019d go out on a limb and say the Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute\u2019s project has some catching up to do with software-based AI systems. Even so, it\u2019s fascinating to watch the project, which (obviously) gets its name from renowned Mexican portrait painter Frida Kahlo.Image Credits: CMUImage Credits: CMU\u201cFRIDA is a project exploring the intersection of human and robotic creativity,\u201d says CMU professor Jim McCann. \u201cFRIDA is using the kind of AI models that have been developed to do things like caption images and understand scene content and applying it to this artistic generative problem.\u201dThe system currently requires some input, including text descriptions and existing images, though in a world so tied to literal interpretations, it can work a bit more abstractly. In one instance, the team played the robot the all-time banger that is ABBA\u2019s \u201cDancing Queen.\u201dThough they also attempt to cut questions of job automations off at the pass. For one thing, humans are required for not just inputs, but actual paint mixing (though, to be clear, it\u2019s realistic to assume that\u2019s fairly automatable). The team suggests that it\u2019s ideal as a collaborator.Image Credits: CMUImage Credits: CMUPerhaps the most interesting piece of this is the system\u2019s imprecision. The goal of such robotics is generally getting things as accurate as possible. Here, however, the system is allowed to make mistakes and adjusts the remainder of the painting accordingly, using an overhead camera to monitor its own progress. Speed isn\u2019t a priority either.

The restructuring comes as VinFast prepares to enter the U.S. public market and delays deliveries to its first customers in the country.VinFast has not shared how many employees have been cut, but a LinkedIn post from a former employee said \u201cnearly 35 roles\u201d were affected. A spokesperson told Reuters the headcount in Vietnam, where most of the company\u2019s staff and engineering ops are, would not shrink.\u201cThe past 4 months have been an experience like no other,\u201d reads the post. \u201cFrom meeting and collaborating with some of the industry\u2019s most talented professionals, to building a team and program with the intention to launch a service nationwide for a startup.\u201dNote the \u201cintention to launch\u201d part of that statement. Neither the employee who wrote the post nor the company have responded to TechCrunch to clarify the nature of the nationwide service and whether VinFast has ceased operations there, but we have some guesses.A big part of VinFast\u2019s luxury EV offering in the U.S. is the customer experience, including a mobile service network and over-the-air firmware updates. The company may have also been pursuing an EV charging network in the States, something VinFast has been doing in Vietnam. Some of the affected employees who posted on LinkedIn worked in mobile service operations and EV charging infrastructure, which might signal VinFast is pulling away from launching these services in North America.VinFast\u2019s expansion strategy into international markets also includes a direct-to-consumer sales model. Many of the 150 people VinFast said it had hired in the U.S. were in sales, support and distribution roles.The company, a subsidiary of conglomerate Vingroup, has been advancing into the U.S. market with four electric SUVs and potentially a sports car. Last week, VinFast said it would delay deliveries to its first U.S. customers to the second half of February as it finishes updating vehicles with the latest software.","11":"Here\u2019s an interesting comment from MIT\u2019s Alfonso Parra Rubio, \u201cTreating soft versus hard robotics is a false dichotomy.\u201d For, I suppose, obvious reasons, thinking around technology tends to be a bit\u2026binary. Certainly we\u2019ve traditionally regarded soft robots as being something that exists in direct opposition to their more traditional counterparts.But the organic beings that inspire them are often some combination of rigid and soft. After all, what are we if not a bunch of soft tissue bound to a rigid skeletal structure. It follows, then, that roboticists would do well to marry the two, in order to harness the best of both worlds.Image Credits: MITImage Credits: MITThis is one of the guiding principles behind MIT\u2019s recent rethink of its underwater, snakelike aquabots. The robot is largely hollow, built of modular voxels that can be assembled to create systems that are rigid in certain directions and soft in others, combing stiff and flexible elements.\u201cSmooth flexibility of the body surface allows us to implement flow control that can reduce drag and improve propulsive efficiency, resulting in substantial fuel saving,\u201d says MIT professor Michael Triantafyllou, who was previously involved in MIT\u2019s RoboTuna project.Thus far, the system has been configured into the kind of meter-long eel design seen in this post, but the modular building blocks mean it\u2019s possible to create a variety of different shapes and scale up the robot\u2019s size considerably.\u201cThere have been many snake-like robots before,\u201d adds fellow MIT professor, Neil Gershenfeld. \u201cBut they\u2019re generally made of bespoke components, as opposed to these simple building blocks that are scalable.\u201dModularity also potentially means dramatically cutting down the assembly time required to build these robots. The 60 pieces in this system were assembled in two days, rather than the two years that went into building RoboTuna.","12":"Therapists \u2014 if you can even find one that takes your insurance or new clients \u2014 can add a layer of sadness to your wallet even as you\u2019re trying to rectify your own mental health wobbles. ShareWell believes it has an alternate take, with a far more affordable peer-support model, which lands it somewhere between special interest forums and online communities, coaching and therapy. The company\u2019s thesis is that people who are in the same proverbial boat can offer each other support (but, emphatically, not advice!) to alleviate the burden of going at it alone.\u201cI started ShareWell because peer support really helped me in what was probably the most difficult phase of my life,\u201d said founder and CEO CeCe Cheng in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cDuring the pandemic, I was in what I would call an emotionally abusive relationship. I had a therapist I was working with and she was really helpful, but when I was going through it, I didn\u2019t really want to talk to my friends about it. I felt a lot of shame; sometimes even the best-meaning friends couldn\u2019t exactly understand what I was going through.\u201d\u2018Self-therapy\u2019 startups are blooming in the \u2018moderate mental health\u2019 spaceCheng set out to put together a better solution for that, to battle her own isolation in her experience, but also to create a tool for people to lean on each other using modalities that already exist. She points to other successful peer-based support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous.A Sharewell session in progress. Image Credits: ShareWell.A Sharewell session in progress. Image Credits: ShareWell.\u201cI looked online, and it was shocking how little I could find; I found dead links, a lack of information, and frustration,\u201d says Cheng. \u201cOften, there was just a zoom link that you joined at a certain time and you hoped that other people showed up. Sometimes it was three people that showed up; other times there were 20. It just didn\u2019t feel very safe. I did find some Reddit forums and Facebook groups, which I thought was pretty shocking at this day and age, that there wasn\u2019t a better place to go.\u201dPeople need all the help they can get. The pandemic aggravated an already critical mental health crisis,\u00a0triggering a 25% increase in depression and anxiety nationally while 77% of Americans live in counties where mental health care is hard to access. The company wants to offer an alternative, with live human support that is effective, affordable and accessible.ShareWell told TechCrunch it raised a $1.3 million pre-seed round, which it says includes investments from Adrian Aoun, CEO and co-founder of Forward; Kyle Vogt, co-founder of Twitch and CEO and co-founder of Cruise; Russell Simmons, former CTO and co-founder of Yelp; Margo Georgiadis, former CEO of Ancestry.com; Charlie Cheever, former CTO and co-founder of Quora; Rob Hayes, first investor in Uber; and Quiet Capital.This startup wants to scale anonymous mental health support \u2013 starting with foundersThat\u2019s a hell of a lineup of investors, and it speaks to Cheng\u2019s deep roots in Silicon Valley; before splitting off from her investor career and founding this company, she was at FirstRound Capital and Makers Fund.Personally, I\u2019m skeptical about turning to the internet for help and advice, given the general quality of information that is available online, but Cheng assures me the company has thought about safety from the bottom up.\u201cWe built a video and community platform with our own safety features. For the video sessions, we have the rule of three, which means that every virtual session requires a host and at least two attendees for the session to start. If at any time a person drops out and it goes below three, everyone goes into a waiting room,\u201d says Cheng. \u201cThe site prohibits one-on-one communication anywhere, which in itself limits abuse cases. We also have sitewide blocking; if there\u2019s something that makes you feel uncomfortable, you can block someone and you will never be in a session with them again, you will not see their forum posts; they are fully blocked. There are also reporting and flagging features everywhere. We also have a rating feature for hosts and for sessions. Bad actors will be flagged, blocked and reported, and if that happens multiple times, the team steps in. We haven\u2019t actually had to do that, as the community is regulating itself.\u201dThe company\u2019s special sauce is in how it thinks of the peer group system, and the accompanying rules. The key aspect is to share your own experiences only, rather than giving advice to the other people on the call.\u201cWe define peer support as the sharing of experience, not advice. That is the number one most important rule in our community guidelines. We are here to share experience and to support each other. We can relate to things that we\u2019ve learned from our personal or professional experiences, but it is against the rules to give advice, to diagnose, etc.,\u201d Cheng says. However, she also says that nobody from ShareWell is actively monitoring sessions in progress. \u201cAnyone can create and host a peer support session after they\u2019ve attended one session on the platform. We have a lot of host training materials, and we support the hosts.\u201dFor mental health startups, happiness is in nichesThe company told me that in instances where someone is clearly struggling and in need of professional help, the hosts were not allowed to encourage someone to seek the assistance of a therapist or other professional.\u201cRight now [asking someone to seek professional help] is frowned upon, because that crosses a line of giving advice, but if I saw someone who I felt needed therapy, I would probably talk about my own experience about how therapy really helped me get through certain things,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cIn the future, we think that we will be able to refer people to modalities beyond peer support. We see already that people want coaching and therapy, etc., but we see peer support as the home base of the community, and from there we connect people to resources outside ShareWell.\u201d","13":"After charming the internet (and us) with its absurdist nature, the AI-generated \u201cSeinfeld\u201d-spoof \u201cNothing, Forever\u201d was suspended from Twitch for 14 days.As part of its parody of \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d one of the recurring scenes on \u201cNothing, Forever\u201d shows Larry Feinberg \u2014 the Jerry Seinfeld character \u2014 performing stand-up routines. Usually, Larry\u2019s jokes went something like, \u201cWhat\u2019s a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear.\u201d But, as \u201cNothing, Forever\u201d creators Mismatch Media told TechCrunch, the team made a mistake with the AI\u2019s content filter, which resulted in Larry delivering a transphobic standup routine.\u201cNothing, Forever,\u201d which has been streaming almost constantly since December, initially generated the characters\u2019 dialogue through the Davinci model of GPT-3, plus OpenAI\u2019s content filtering protocol. But when Davinci began having technical issues, the team switched to the less-sophisticated Curie model. After changing models, the creators didn\u2019t appropriately incorporate the AI moderation tool. Soon, Larry was spewing transphobic jokes, and \u201cNothing, Forever\u201d was suspensed.\u201cFirst, let me say that the text we generated was a mistake, we are super embarrassed, and that the generative content created in no way reflects the values or opinions of our staff,\u201d co-creator Skyler Hartle wrote in an email to TechCrunch. \u201cWe very much regret this happened and hope to be back on the air soon, with all the appropriate safeguards in place.\u201dHartle also said that the team is investigating a secondary content moderation system to add as a redundancy, just in case their content moderation filters happen to falter while live on air.Twitch did not respond to request for comment. Hartle said he has not had any direct communication with Twitch either. But the creators believe the suspension is a result of Larry\u2019s transphobic comments, due to the timing of the suspension.Twitch\u2019s community guidelines ban hateful rhetoric about specific identity groups, including discrimination or harassment based on gender identity. The platform\u2019s content moderation systems appear to have caught the transphobic rhetoric of Larry, an AI, pretty quickly. But while Twitch\u2019s systems reacted quickly to deplatform an AI, it has not been as consistently successful with mitigating the deliberate harassment of transgender people.About a year and a half ago, the platform was plagued by malicious \u201chate raids,\u201d which particularly targeted Black and transgender creators. After creator-led collective action, Twitch rolled out new safety features to help protect streamers from these violent cyberattacks. Last year, as transgender Twitch streamer Keffals rose to prominence for talking about LGBTQ+ issues, she was subject to such harsh harassment that she was targeted within her own home, causing her to go into hiding. (Much of this harassment stemmed from other websites, but as of 2021, Twitch\u2019s community guidelines can hold Twitch users accountable for off-platform harassment.)The creators of \u201cNothing, Forever\u201d say they did not intend to air transphobic commentary, and that they do not endorse those views. Yet this predicament shows how quickly generative AI entertainment can go south when left unchecked. After all, GPT-3 is trained on the internet itself, so it can echo some of the most heinous rhetoric from across the web.There\u2019s something darkly ironic about this incident: A content filtering snafu drove the Twitch suspension of what\u2019s basically a robot. Meanwhile, Dave Chappelle just won a Grammy for his comedy album \u201cThe Closer,\u201d which has been heavily criticized for its transphobia. Yet even within the AI-generated universe of \u201cNothing, Forever,\u201d the AI-generated audience didn\u2019t find Larry\u2019s jokes very funny.\u201cThere\u2019s like 50 people here and no one is laughing. Anyone have any suggestions?\u201d the AI began its comedy set, before going on its brief transphobic tirade. Then, Larry closed his set, \u201cNo one is laughing, so I\u2019m going to stop. Thanks for coming out tonight. See you next time. Where\u2019d everybody go?\u201d\u2018Nothing, Forever,\u2019 an AI \u2018Seinfeld\u2019 spoof, is the next \u2018Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon\u2019Streamers are boycotting Twitch today to protest the platform\u2019s lack of action on \u2018hate raids\u2019Twitch builds toward a \u2018layered\u2019 safety approach with new moderator tools","14":"It was a rough quarter for the cloud infrastructure market as companies looked for ways to cut back on spending in an uncertain economy. When you combine that with the strong dollar and a weak Chinese market, the market slowed to 21% growth, a precipitous drop from the 36% growth we had seen the year prior.While we aren\u2019t seeing the gaudy growth of years past, Synergy Research still found the market exceeded $61 billion for the quarter with the 12 month trailing revenues of over $212 billion, a hefty sum by any measure, even with the slowdown.Also of note was that while each of The Big Three saw growth slow in Q4 2022 from the previous quarter, Microsoft still managed to gain market share ground on Amazon. Microsoft increased its share from 23%, up from 21% the prior quarter, while Amazon fell from 34% to 33% and Google remained steady at 11%. The Big Three cloud providers accounted for 66% of worldwide cloud revenue.That comes out to approximately $20 billion for Amazon, $14 billion for Microsoft and $7 billion for Google. Per usual, this is looking at IaaS, PaaS and hosted private cloud services. It doesn\u2019t include SaaS, which is measured separately.Image Credits: Synergy ResearchImage Credits: Synergy ResearchAmazon cloud revenue grew a modest 20% over the prior year, and the company acknowledged in the earnings call that growth dropped even further to the mid-teens in the first month of the year. Meanwhile Microsoft reported cloud growth of 22%, down from 24% the prior quarter and Google Cloud revenue grew 32%, down from the 38% growth the previous quarter.Amazon was first to market and has had a long head start, but it seems as the market slows after years of steady growth, it\u2019s giving its chief competitor, Microsoft, a bit of an opening to gain on them. It could be partly due at least to the fact that Amazon\u2019s market maturity is finally catching up to it, and Microsoft is able to gain some advantage in spite of spending slowing overall.John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy says there were three key reasons for this quarter\u2019s drop-off, which he believes are short-term issues, and he remains optimistic for the future. \u201cThere are three main factors. The strengthened US dollar diminishes the apparent growth rate of many non-US markets; the large Chinese market remains constrained by pandemic issues and local policies; and the worsened economy has caused some enterprises to more closely review spending on cloud services. These factors should be primarily short term in nature and Synergy forecasts that growth rates will remain strong over the next few years,\u201d he said in a statement.It will be interesting to watch the market in 2023 and see how the macro economic environment affects revenue, and if the slower growth we\u2019ve been seeing continues to work in favor of Amazon\u2019s competitors by enabling them to gain more ground.","15":"Pakistan has unblocked Wikipedia in the South Asian market, three days after the online encyclopedia was censored in the nation over noncompliance with removing what the local regulator deemed as \u201csacrilegious\u201d content.Shehbaz Sharif, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, directed the unblocking order, calling the censorship on Wikipedia \u201cnot a suitable measure to restrict access to some objectionable contents\/sacrilegious matter on it.\u201d\u201cThe unintended consequences of this blanket ban, therefore, outweigh its benefits,\u201d his office wrote in a letter, which was shared publicly on Twitter.Sharif has also constituted a cabinet committee that will include ministers for IT and Telecom, Law and Justices, Information and Broadcasting, Commerce and Communications\u201d on matters related to Wikipedia and other online content, including exploring and recommending alternative technical measures for removal or blocking access to objectionable content.The Pakistani telecom regulator \u201cdegraded\u201d access to Wikipedia last Wednesday and warned that it would fully block the site in 48 hours if certain content weren\u2019t removed from the site. The regulator had asserted that Wikipedia representatives weren\u2019t acknowledging the order. On Friday, Wikipedia was banned in the country.The South Asian nation\u2019s move to block the website received wide backlash and global media attention.\u201cWe hope that the Pakistan government joins us in a commitment to knowledge as a human right and restores access to @Wikipedia and Wikimedia projects promptly, so that the people of Pakistan can continue to receive and share knowledge with the world,\u201d Wikimedia, the parent firm of Wikipedia, said on Saturday.The English version of Wikipedia receives over 50 million page views per month from Pakistan, Wikimedia said.\u201cThe Wikimedia Foundation does not make decisions around what content is included on Wikipedia or how that content is maintained.

There\u2019s a lot of fintech news out there and it\u2019s my job to stay on top of it \u2014 and make sense of it \u2014 so you can stay in the know. \u2014 Mary AnnGreetings from Austin, Texas, where an ice storm hit last week and caused widespread damage across the city. I know, I know \u2014 Austin is known for its 100+ degree temperatures in the summertime. Who would have expected this to happen here? And not just once but twice in two years. Surely not I, when my family moved here in 2013. We\u2019re going on Day 5 with no power, heat or internet. That\u2019s why this newsletter is being published a day later than it would have under normal circumstances. Our neighborhood has many beautiful mature trees, including many oaks. It\u2019s one of the things we loved most about it when deciding to live here. It\u2019s also the same reason our neighborhood was hit SO hard by this storm. Branches from one of those trees fell on our power line, making the outage not just inconvenient but also scary. While this has been extremely stressful \u2014 my 89-year-old mother lives with us and our biggest priority has been trying to keep her warm and comfortable \u2014 there have been bright spots, like the kindness of a neighbor I\u2019d never met before sharing a wheelchair so I could transport my mother somewhere else and a friend who offered a portable generator so that we could at least have some power for a little while. Anyway, hopefully by the time I\u2019m writing this next week, we\u2019ll have our actual power back. Fingers crossed.Image Credits: Amy TomlinsonImage Credits: Amy TomlinsonThere appears to be no end in sight for layoffs in the fintech space. PayPal was the latest large company to announce layoffs \u2014 with about 2,000 full-time employees, or 7% of its workforce, affected. On January 30, the payments giant publicly shared a letter that president and CEO Dan Schulman had sent to employees in which he noted the cuts would take place over the coming weeks \u201cwith some organizations impacted more than others.\u201d Schulman added: \u201cOver the past year, we made significant progress in strengthening and reshaping our company to address the challenging macro-economic environment\u2026While we have made substantial progress in right-sizing our cost structure, and focused our resources on our core strategic priorities, we have more work to do. We must continue to change as our world, our customers, and our competitive landscape evolve.\u201dHe did not provide further details, saying only the company would provide the affected \u201cwith generous packages, engage in consultation where required, and support them with their transitions.\u201dThe company\u2019s stock perked up on the news. After closing at $79.64 on January 30, shares closed up 7.4% at $85.52 on February 3.It\u2019s not the first round of layoffs for PayPal in recent times. Last spring, TechCrunch reported that PayPal had laid off dozens of employees from its San Jose headquarters around a week before the fintech confirmed that it was shuttering its San Francisco office. To better understand why it matters so much to us what publicly traded companies like PayPal do, head here.But PayPal was not the only publicly traded fintech to lay off employees last week. The Wall Street Journal reported that SoFi Technologies was cutting around 65 jobs, or about 5% of its 1,300-person workforce. The company\u2019s mortgage operations centers in California and Utah are reportedly impacted by the move.Meanwhile, Silicon Hills News (operated by the very talented Laura Lorek) reported that Austin-based insurtech Decent is \u201cshutting down all of its operations to just a core team,\u201d which was confirmed in a blog post published by Nick Soman, the company\u2019s founder and CEO. The company had raised $43 million in funding from investors such as Foundation Capital, QED Investors and Maverick Ventures, according to Silicon Hills. In his blog post, Soman said the company wound down its health insurance product in anticipation of signing on a partner, who recently backed out in what the founder called \u201ca massive and unexpected setback.\u201dAnd lastly (that we know of), DriveWealth confirmed that it has reduced its headcount by 20%, the company told TC\u2019s Natasha Mascarenhas. In a statement, DriveWealth told her that the cuts were part of \u201ca number of strategic decisions to evolve as a global brokerage infrastructure company, with a tech-focused and product- and partner-centric organization, and increased organizational agility.\u201d In January, DriveWealth CEO Terry Angelos announced on Twitter that he was \u201cleaving the digital custody and clearing firm just eight months after stepping into the role,\u201d according to InvestmentNews. The company has raised over $550 million since its 2012 inception, according to Crunchbase. It last raised in August of 2021 \u2014 a $450 million Series D funding round at a $2.85 billion valuation. Insight Partners and Accel co-led that round. Other backers include Greyhound Capital, SoftBank Vision Fund and Point72 Ventures. According to PitchBook, DriveWealth has 300 employees, although it is not clear if that was before or after the recent layoffs.It\u2019s apparent that even well-funded companies are not immune to the challenging macroenvironment. In fact, is it just me or does it seem like it\u2019s the most well-funded companies that are doing the layoffs? Maybe since they had more resources and the ability to hire to begin with? Or maybe because they are more high-profile, news of their layoffs makes a bigger splash? I\u2019m not sure, but sadly I don\u2019t think the fintech job cuts are slowing down anytime soon. Stay tuned for a new section in upcoming newsletters that focuses on companies that are hiring, rather than laying off.Marqeta shared with me exclusively that it has agreed to acquire two-year-old fintech infrastructure startup Power Finance for $223 million in cash, marking the first acquisition in the publicly traded company\u2019s 13-year history. I had the opportunity to interview new CEO Simon Khalaf, who shared with me the reasoning behind the purchase.

Plus, I covered this company in December 2020 when it raised $27 million in an \u201coversubscribed\u201d Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). This time around, Commerce Ventures led the financing, which also included participation from repeat backers a16z and Bain Capital Ventures, as well as Visa and Sorenson Ventures. It\u2019s always interesting when previous backers double down on their investments, and in this case, several existing backers put money in this round.What does it do? Moov was born when CEO and founder Wade Arnold and Bob Smith started an open source movement in 2017 to help developers learn how to build and integrate payments into their products. Arnold had founded Banno, a white label digital banking platform, which was acquired by Jack Henry in 2014 (Smith was an employee). Their goal at the time of inception, Arnold said in 2020, was \u201cto lend a trusted hand to developers building or integrating financial products.\u201d It has since worked to build what Arnold describes as its \u201cfull-stack approach to powering payments.\u201dIn the past, the company has been public about \u201ctaking business from Stripe.\u201d Still, at the time of Moov\u2019s last raise, Arnold told me: \u201cStripe simplified e-commerce checkout for all by putting developers first. Moov echoes the ethos in putting developers first but we\u2019re focused on the underpinning infrastructure of payments and banking. We would like to think that Stripe could have leveraged Moov if we existed when they started.\u201dFun fact: In 2021, the startup created fintech_devcon, a flagship event for fintech developers.

The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency trading platform by volume said it had acquired a majority stake in South Korea-based crypto exchange GOPAX.\u00a0In November, GOPAX suspended customer withdrawals from its DeFi service, GoFi, after suffering effects from the bankrupt lender Genesis Global Trading, a Digital Currency Group (DCG) subsidiary. Genesis offered yields on crypto lending to GOPAX, and DCG, which invested in GOPAX in April 2021, is the second largest shareholder of GOPAX. In addition, GOPAX\u2019s parent company, Streami, is one of the 10 largest creditors of Genesis.\u00a0The new capital from Binance will enable GOPAX customers to make withdrawals and interest payments to normalize the Korean crypto trading platform. GOPAX had more than 600,000 users as of March 2021, per its website. A spokesperson of Binance told TechCrunch that Binance also plans to offer Binance Academy, a blockchain and cryptocurrency education platform, to GOPAX users to improve blockchain, cryptocurrency and web3 awareness.\u00a0\u00a0Binance says its capital came from the Industry Recovery Initiative (IRI), a Binance-led co-investment project. Binance has set up IRI to protect users in the web3 industry and has committed $1 billion to the IRI project. Other firms in the web3 industry participated in the IRI project, including Jump Crypto, Polygon Ventures, Aptos Labs and Animoca Brands.\u00a0\u201cThe Industry Recovery Initiative (IRI) was created to support promising companies that were negatively impacted by the events of last year,\u201d Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, founder and CEO of Binance, said in its statement. \u201cWe hope that taking this step with GOPAX will further rebuild the Korean crypto and blockchain industry.\u201d\u00a0Binance did not disclose the stake size or deal valuation of the acquisition. Still, according to a local media outlet in January, Binance was in advanced talks to purchase a 41.2% stake in GOPAX from the company\u2019s largest shareholder, GOPAX CEO Junhaeng Lee.\u00a0GOPAX is one of the five cryptocurrency exchanges (Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit and GOPAX) in South Korea. Upbit has the largest market share, with 76.6% in terms of traded value in 2021, followed by Bithumb and Coinone with 18.5% and 4.5%, respectively, per crypto research firm Xangle\u2019s report.\u00a0The latest acquisition comes nearly two months after Binance acquired Sakura Exchange BitCoin (SEBC) in Japan for an undisclosed amount as Binance eyes expanding its footprint in the East Asian market again.Binance reentered Japan last year via the SEBC acquisition, two years after it paused its service in the Japanese market. Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency (FSA) issued warnings to Binance, which operated without proper registration and license, in 2018 and 2021. Binance said it \u201csecured its first license in East Asia by acquiring SEBC. Binance also said in its statement that it \u201cis committed to collaborating with the South Korean regulators and virtual asset stakeholders to explore how Binance can leverage its technology and liquidity to support the local ecosystem.\u201d The spokesperson at Binance did not provide further details on the ongoing conversations regarding licenses and registrations in South Korea.\u00a0South Korea is working\u00a0to regulate the crypto sector to protect investors in the wake of a series of bankruptcies and accusations of fraud in the global web3 space last year; earlier this year, Japan also called for\u00a0other countries to regulate crypto as strictly as banks.\u00a0Binance has obtained regulatory approvals or authorizations in many countries, including Japan, France, Italy, Spain, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, New Zealand and more.\u00a0GOPAX did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for further comment.(Updates with comment from Binance in third and tenth paragraphs.)Binance poised for Japan expansion after buying local exchange Sakura","18":"Q&A platform Quora has opened up public access to its new AI chatbot app, Poe, which lets users ask questions and get answers from a range of AI chatbots, including those from ChatGPT maker, OpenAI, and other companies like Anthropic. Beyond allowing users to experiment with new AI technologies, Poe\u2019s content will ultimately help to evolve Quora itself, the company says.Quora first announced Poe\u2019s mobile app in December, but at the time, it required an invite to try it out. With the public launch on Friday, anyone can now use Poe\u2019s app. For now, it\u2019s available only to iOS users, but Quora says the service will arrive on other platforms in a few months.In an announcement, the company explained it decided to launch Poe as a standalone product that\u2019s independent of Quora itself because of how quickly AI developments and changes are now taking place. However, there will be some connections between the Q&A site and Poe. If and when Poe\u2019s content meets a high enough quality standard, it will be distributed on Quora\u2019s site itself, where it has the ability to reach Quora\u2019s 400 million monthly visitors, the company noted.To use Poe \u2014 which stands for \u201cPlatform for Open Exploration\u201d \u2014 iOS users will have to create an account that\u2019s verified with both a phone number and email address. They can then switch between three different AI chatbots available at launch.These include the general knowledge chatbots Sage, Claude and Dragonfly. Both Sage and Dragonfly are powered by OpenAI while Claude is powered by Anthropic technology. All have their own limitations at present. For instance, Sage and Claude don\u2019t have knowledge of events after 2021, and Dragonfly may refuse to answer some questions. All three have been known to make incorrect statements \u2014 which is another reason why Quora itself isn\u2019t immediately integrating Poe into its service.Image Credits: Poe screenshotImage Credits: Poe screenshotThe factual inaccuracies offered by AIs like ChatGPT have raised concerns about whether these technologies are ready for primetime. The Wall Street Journal, for example, recently reported how ChatGPT has been shown to be fairly bad at math problems written in natural language, often returning entertaining, but entirely wrong answers with confidence. Another Q&A site, Stack Overflow, also banned users from posting answers created by ChatGPT because of inaccuracies.Quora, however, sees Poe\u2019s potential in helping AI developers with making their models more useful for the public, by offering an easy-to-use chat interface \u2014 something that\u2019s not always the focus for companies building the AI models themselves.\u201d \u2026 most people and even most companies who are capable of training or fine-tuning these models are not well suited to create these interfaces,\u201d explained the Quora blog post, penned by Quora CEO Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cThis is particularly true in the back-and-forth dialogue paradigm that has become standard for question answering and other use of large language models like ChatGPT, but we expect it to become useful for other modalities as well. We hope that Poe can fill this gap and greatly reduce the amount of work needed for any AI developer to reach a large audience of users.\u201dTo make Poe more accessible to developers, it plans to offer an API that any AI developer can plug their model into to reach a large, public audience.\u201cWe foresee a large number of models available in the near future. Different models will be optimized for different tasks, they will represent different points of view, or they will have access to different knowledge,\u201d D\u2019Angelo said also in a Twitter thread announcing Poe\u2019s public launch.In addition to providing an easy way to ask questions of the AI bots, Poe includes some social components. The app lets you create a profile and follow others. Users can publish model output on their profiles, if they choose, making it accessible to their followers. The best examples will also be distributed to all users of Poe through the app\u2019s feed, where others can Like or Repost the chatbot Q&A session. You can move through the feed similar to how you navigate Stories in other social apps \u2014 by tapping on the side of the screen to advance or go back to the prior post.Poe also offers buttons you can tap within each chatbot that let you see what others have shared.The app itself is a free download without in-app purchases on the App Store.Quora launches Poe, a way to talk to AI chatbots like ChatGPT","19":"Welcome back to\u00a0Equity, the podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.

Bard, the company\u2019s new AI experiment, aims to \u201ccombine the breadth of the world\u2019s knowledge with the power, intelligence, and creativity of our large language models.\u201d Not short on ambition, Google!The model, or service, or AI chatbot, however you wish to describe it, was announced in a blog post by CEO Sundar Pichai. He pointedly notes Google\u2019s recentering around AI some years back, as well as the fact that the most influential concept (the Transformer) was created by the company\u2019s researchers in 2017.\u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting time to be working on these technologies as we translate deep research and breakthroughs into products that truly help people,\u201d Pichai writes. It\u2019s hard not to wonder while reading this how Google managed to get leapfrogged so decisively by OpenAI, the latter of which is now synonymous with the technologies the former pioneered.The short explanation is that tech moves fast and big companies move slow, and while Google released paper after paper and tried to figure out how to fit AI into its existing business strategies, OpenAI has focused on making the best models and let people figure out their own applications.Bard shows Google taking a page from that playbook, releasing a \u201clightweight\u201d version of the model for testing purposes. The model uses Google\u2019s own LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) to power a conversational AI that can also draw on information from the web. How exactly it does that is not clear from the blog post, but it appears to at least keep more or less current.Bard \u201chelp[s] explain new discoveries from NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old, or learn more about the best strikers in football right now, and then get drills to build your skills.\u201dImage Credits: GoogleImage Credits: GoogleGoogle of course maintains the most up to date record of web content on Earth, and no doubt Bard will be using that information to its benefit, but exactly how it processes and packages that information for you and your nine-year-old will only be clear once people start using it.The post notes you can also use Bard to \u201cplan a friend\u2019s baby shower,\u201d \u201ccompare two Oscar-nominated movies\u201d and \u201cplan a trip to Ecuador.\u201d One can picture how an AI model might do any of these things using the various search results and data firehoses Google has access to, but this experiment will likely be limited to telling you stuff, not doing deep integrations with things like your calendar or airlines.Of course every conversational AI must face the inevitable (these days, almost instant) attempts to bait it into saying something hateful, foolish or embarrassing. Google will surely be recording conversations with users \u201cto make sure Bard\u2019s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety, and groundedness in real-world information.\u201d The last one is clearly a shot across OpenAI\u2019s bows, as well as Microsoft\u2019s, since the former\u2019s models don\u2019t cite their sources and the latter\u2019s short-lived Galactica famously invented them.(Update: \u201cIn light of recent announcements,\u201d Microsoft has now made public a previously confidential event being held tomorrow in Redmond. The topic is not officially declared but it is widely expected to be a Bing-OpenAI tie-up that brings a next-generation language model to Microsoft\u2019s perennially beleaguered search engine. An early version of the features was reportedly tested and leaked by student Owen Lin, but we have been unable to confirm anything from that post.)AI will be coming to Google Search more directly in the form of several new features \u201cwhich can help synthesize insights for questions where there is no one right answer. Soon, you\u2019ll see these AI-powered features in Search that distill complex information and multiple viewpoints into easy-to-digest formats, so you can quickly understand the big picture and learn more from the web,\u201d the company said in a separate email. Nuance but bullet point format, got it.While no doubt people will ask it variations on the Trolley Problem, the example provided is someone asking \u201cIs piano or guitar easier to learn and how much practice does each need?\u201dImage Credits: GoogleImage Credits: GoogleNot an ethically charged query (for most) but also not necessarily one with a simple result. But if of a hundred articles comparing the various learning rates of instruments there is some sort of consensus about the difficulty, with various caveats and tips also common, Google can just suck those up and pop them at the top of the search results.Questions abound: isn\u2019t that just plagiarism? Will sponsored results go above or below, and will they be included and\/or promoted within the AI framework? What qualifies as a question with no right answer? Can users customize the results or crawling process?We may very well learn the answers to these questions at Google\u2019s Search and AI event Wednesday morning, one that strangely goes unmentioned in Pichai\u2019s post.

Even if the recipient used the funds to make payments or donations to third parties \u2014 including charities \u2014 it doesn\u2019t prevent them from having to return it, according to the statement.This announcement follows public requests from FTX in late December for recipients to return funds voluntarily.\u201cTo the extent such payments are not returned voluntarily, the FTX Debtors reserve the right to commence actions before the Bankruptcy Court to require the return of such payments, with interest accruing from the date any action is commenced,\u201d it said in the statement.In mid-January, FTX debtors identified $1.7 billion of cash and $3.5 billion of crypto assets and $3 million of securities, according to a company statement. This totals about $5.5 billion in liquid assets, which FTX\u2019s new CEO, John Jay Ray III, referred to as a \u201cherculean\u201d effort to assess the firm\u2019s financial position.In the past, Ray, who took over after the exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, has previously stated that donations from FTX should be recovered. Ray has also said there\u2019s a possibility for the exchange to restart and that \u201ceverything is on the table.\u201dLost your crypto amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings? You\u2019re probably not getting it backA public spreadsheet by OpenSecrets, a nonprofit monitoring money in politics, tracked over $84 million in donations to political candidates and organizations between Bankman-Fried, former FTX co-CEO Ryan Salame and FTX\u2019s former engineering head, Nishad Singh.Before the exchange\u2019s demise, Bankman-Fried was well known for his support of the U.S. Democratic Party and was one of the largest donors in the runup to the 2020 presidential election and the 2022 midterms.The biggest single recipient was Protect Our Future, a PAC that aims to \u201chelp elect candidates who will be champions for pandemic prevention.\u201d The group got $28 million from Bankman-Fried, according to OpenSecret.He also contributed donations to Democratic Senators Debbie Stabenow, Kirsten Gillibrand, Maggie Hassan and Cory Booker, as well as Republican Senators John Boozman, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins.The majority of Bankman-Fried\u2019s donations were traced to Democrats, but he also claimed in an interview with reporter Tiffany Fong that he donated \u201cabout the same amount\u201d to the Republican Party as well. \u201cThat was not generally known,\u201d he added.\u201cAll my Republication donations were dark,\u201d Bankman-Fried said in the interview two months ago, explaining that the donations were not publicly disclosed through official filings. \u201cThe reason was not for regulatory reasons, it was because reporters freak the fuck out if you donate to Republicans. They\u2019re all super liberal and I didn\u2019t want to have that fight.\u201dAs the deadline to return funds is just weeks away, candidates and political groups may surface in response to the request. Whether those donations are returned has yet to be determined, and this may be just one step in a prolonged, lengthy legal case for FTX to claw back funds."}}
